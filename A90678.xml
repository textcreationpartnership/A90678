            <title>The Gospel nevv-creature; wherein the work of the spirit is opened, in awakening the soul; to the getting pardon of sin, and an interest in Jesus Christ; without which, it is undone to all eternity. Discovering the false refuges, and vain hopes for heaven, of ignorant and formal professors in this nation, tending to rouze them out of their carnal security, before it be too late. Whereunto is added, (by way of comfort, to all dejected soules) the tempestuous soul calmed by Jesus Christ. / By A.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat which drew theſe Papers from me, will be Argument enough for me, againſt the cenſure of what weakneſſes are mixt in this Poor piece. Which I muſt needs ſo call as it comes from my ſelf, but dare not undervalue, what of the leaſt of the Spirit of God appears in it; every drop and taſt of which, is of an infinite price, where ever it appear. Some years ſince, the Lord (for ſo, through grace, I find the iſſue) put upon my heart to ſend forth a little token of ſoul-experience to my friends, ſtiled, <hi>The tempeſtuous Soul calmed, &amp;c.</hi> Which I found, God made a bleſſing to ſome poor ſouls, (ſo can the Lord make uſe of weak things); and I have been called upon, and ſent to, by ſtrangers for Books, but had none of them: The Stationer alſo ſending me word, that he deſired to reprint it, and that I would make ſome addition to it, if I thought meet. Theſe importunities were as the voice of the Lord to me, and being then preaching upon the ſubjects I have here added, (which were but as an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other in the former part, but carryed
<pb facs="tcp:170425:4"/>
further in the opening the <hi>New-Creature</hi>) It came upon my heart, that I could not give out (as I humbly apprehended) what might be more generally uſeful in theſe dayes, for the Country-people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom chiefly my poor labours are laid out; wherein they may, as in a glaſſe, particularly and plainly ſee, if God open their eyes, the woful miſtakes and heart-deluſions, in the great buſineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the moſt, it may well be feared, lye under; fit to be mourned over, with tears of blood, had we Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers hearts to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Add to this, the infinite obligation that lies upon me, (I muſt ſay, above any ſoul upon the face of the earth) from my dear Lord Jeſus, to do for him with all my might, to leave no way unattempted, wherein I might witneſs to his bleſſed Name, and the wayes of his Grace, and help-on poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to him; who have had my hands ſo deep in the blood of my Lord, (over whom I would mourn) and in the blood of the ſouls of ſinners, when I helpt on (to my everlaſting abaſement be it ſpoken, and the magnifying of grace) their hardening in ſin and condemnation, in the daies of my high rebellion againſt the long-ſuffering of my God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> I have many dear Relations and Kindred, with others to whom I am known, ſpecially in this County of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> (where I have found mercy in my labours, and an effectual door opened with other my Fellow-labourers in Chriſt) in whoſe hearts I
<pb facs="tcp:170425:4"/>
have room (which I would wonder at) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this way from my ſelf would be acceptable, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily rather then that which is more worthy, from a ſtranger; which conſiderations, do much ſecure me against cenſure. Upon which account, I give it up to the Lord, in the ſimplicity of my ſoul, and beg a gracious bleſsing upon it, to every ſoul into whoſe hands it may come.</p>
            <p>Specially, My friends after the fleſh, to whom I have not frequent opportunity to ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, whoſe ſouls are upon my heart to mourn for; I beſeech you, and charge you in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Chriſt Jeſus, that you will never reſt in your ſpirits till, through infinite mercy and bleſſing upon your diligence, you ſhall find what is here written to be your own gracious experience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſouls; Oh! do not dare to reſt in a general notion of mercy, in a blind hope-well, a ſober and righteous (through reformed) converſation, or in a mere taking up to a better obedience; no, nor in mere notions of free-grace, and of Jeſus Chriſt; but get (as convinced of ſin ſo) emptyed of your ſelves, and all your own righteouſneſs, to come as <hi>nothing elſe but ſinners,</hi> to Jeſus Christ for all, to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> in his righteouſneſs, and <hi>rooted</hi> into him, and ſo become <hi>New Creatures in him,</hi> and <hi>in him</hi> have your <hi>fruit unto holineſs,</hi> and the <hi>end everlaſting life;</hi> Which things are the main ſcope of this Piece directed chiefly to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170425:5"/>The ſame things I would ſay to you, who were the hearers of theſe diſcourſes as preach'd unto you. Such of you who yet ſtand off from the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, Oh! may this word take you in a ſerious reading, whom it hath not in the preaching of it; Baffle not, (Oh do not) with your own Convictions &amp; Conſciences any longer; Oh! may you yet break off from your ſnares, lying-hopes, offences, ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſses, heartleſs formalities, and wait for the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, in the miniſtration of the Goſpel; yet the hand of the Lord is ſtretched forth unto you. Oh! be not any longer a diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and a gain-ſaying people: God and Angels, and your own Conſciences will witneſſe, how oft the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath called by me, and you have not anſwered.</p>
            <p>To you, who have before the Lord and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, profeſſed obedience to the call of Chriſt, and ſubjection to his Goſpel, I will ſay no more but this; that I hope you never expect to look the Lord Jeſus, in the face at the day of his appearing, but as you are justified only in his righteouſneſs, rooted in him, and are new Creatures in him. That I may be your rejoycing, and you mine in that day; Study exactly the evidences of the New-Creature, and through grace, walk after them; which I would alſo preſſe upon ſuch of the Profeſſors of godlineſs, who may peruſe this plain Piece; ſpecially the Churches of Chriſt I have ſpecial Communion with, in theſe parts;
<pb facs="tcp:170425:5"/>
Let not young Converts reſt only in having lively affections, but get diſtinctly bottom'd upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving myſtery of the Goſpel through Jeſus Christ, <hi>grounded, rooted, eſtabliſh'd</hi> upon, and in a Scripture-Chriſt, as the truth is in Ieſus; and abandon any other ſpirit but a <hi>Scripture-Spirit;</hi> which (bleſſed be rich grace) hath hitherto kept you, and led you in the way of life and peace; <hi>Now the Lord of Peace himſelf, give you peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, by all means; The Lord be with you all, 1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5.16.</hi>

            <p>Reader, who ever thou art, if thou art, by grace, helpt-on to Jeſus Chriſt, by what is here preſented to thee; or in the walk of the New Creature in Chriſt; Give the Lord the glory, and pray that he may do ſo alſo, even in every thing, who would gladly approve himſelf,</p>

            <p>I ſhall hint ſome Reaſons of the Truth, why it is, that the pardon of ſins doth, or ſhould, ſo greatly take up the hearts of ſinfull creatures.</p>
            <p>Reaſons 1. The pardon of ſin ſhould thus greatly take up the hearts of all that indeed expect pardon, <hi>becauſe twas the greatest thing</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>that ever took up Gods heart, how a ſinner might be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> He laid forth more of his <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> about it, then in the making of the Heavens and the Earth; The framing of the New Covenant, the giving out of his eternall Son Jeſus Chriſt, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his fleſh, ſuch a glorious way of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling juſtice and mercy through the death of Chriſt, (the choiceſt piece of divine wiſdom that ever was brought forth) they were all converſant about, and their proper tendency was about this great and weighty concernment, <hi>how,</hi> and that a ſinner <hi>might</hi> be pardoned; when <hi>Moſes</hi> had that bleſſed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and parley with the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. &amp; 34. and <hi>Moſes</hi> getting nearer and nearer to God, who was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170425:8"/>
glimpſing out a ray of glory upon him, breakes out, <hi>Shew me thy glory. I will,</hi> ſaith God, I will ſhew thee what way of glory I moſt deſign to my ſelf among the Sons of men, — <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> And as if this had not been enough (the heart of the bleſſed God was ſo infinitely taken with it) <hi>Chap.</hi> 34, 5, 6. The Lord comes nearer to him, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a Cloud, and ſtood with him there;</hi> and, as if meerly to have ſpoken what he had before ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> namely, <hi>That he ſhould have mercy,</hi> had not been enough, at <hi>verſe</hi> 6, He <hi>proclaimes</hi> it, and makes it as his proper <hi>Name,</hi> and moſt glorious <hi>Title, The Lord, The Lord God, Mercifull and Gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>forgiving iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>forgiving iniquity</hi> were the great deſign of glory he had upon the world; his heart moſt affected and taken up with it; This is the firſt reaſon; poor ſinners ſhould have their hearts moſt taken up about the pardon of ſins, becauſe the heart of the infinite wiſe and bleſſed God is moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The pardon of ſin ſhould ſo greatly take up the heart of a poor guilty ſinner, becauſe, <hi>Nothing, is a a Bleſſing to a man till his ſins are pardoned, but All a curſe.</hi> The Scripture is well known that proves it, among many, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15, 16. <q>If thou wilt not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to do all his Commandments, and his Statutes which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this day that all thoſe curſes ſhall come upon thee &amp; overtake thee; Curſed ſhall thou be in the City, &amp; curſed ſhalt thou be in the field, Curſed ſhall be thy bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket &amp; thy Store. Curſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, &amp; the fruit of thy Land, the encreaſe of thy kin, &amp; the flocks of thy ſheep, Curſed ſhalt thou be when thou comeſt in, &amp;.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170425:9"/>
curſed ſhall thou be when thou goeſt out, the Lord ſhall ſend upon thee curſing, vexation, and rebuke in all that thou ſetteſt thine hand unto for to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now that ſoul that doth not hearken to the voice of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the New-Covenant, to come unto Jeſus Chriſt, to have his ſins pardoned, to have the ſpirit given him to walk before God in all his wayes, is in an unpardoned condition, and ſo liable to all theſe curſes; now, under the old Teſtament God did more uſually come forth in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtroakes of puniſhment upon outward mercies: but under the New Teſtament, his judgements (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon ſuch as are under the Goſpell) are more ſpirituall, (as bleſſings to his people run in a more ſpirituall way) as in curſing them with hardneſſe and blindneſſe of heart, having <hi>reſiſted</hi> the truth, but yet though ſuch outward curſes are not ſo viſibly and frequently executed, (though ſometime they are) yet unpardoned, unconverted ſinners enjoy not their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things as a bleſſing, but they ſerve but to further their damnation, if their hearts are not (through infinite grace) made ſoft, and turn unto the Lord that they may be pardoned. Now, to have outward mercyes, and be hardned in an impenitent eſtate under them, is a farr greater curſe, then to have them ſmitten or imbittered from the Lord, though with the heavieſt hand. This is the 2d. Reaſon of the point: Every thing is a curſe, (while ſuch) to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned ſinner; therefore tis of the greateſt weight to have his heart taken up about it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The perſon of an unpardoned ſinner is hated of the Lord,</hi> therefore the weight of it is very great; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity. All,</hi> be they what they will, high or low, rich or poor, God <hi>hates</hi> them;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170425:9"/>
and while they are workers of iniquity, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unpardoned; what they may be in the decree of God, is nothing to that ſinner in this condition: while he is a worker of iniquity, he hath no ground for any other apprehenſion of God, unles he turn in unto him; Now, what a dreadfull thing is it, to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that great and righteous God, a drop of whoſe wrath is able to ſcortch the ſoul with unſpeakable torment; yet ſuch is the condition of a wretched unpardoned ſinner: therefore tis his great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to look to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>While a ſinner is unpardoned he is under the law.</hi> What that is, I ſhall, if God will, further diſcover; He ſtands bound over to the moſt exact fullfilling of it, under the penalty of Hell, bound to make God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the utmoſt, upon the leaſt breach; and being under tranſgreſſion of it, is under wrath and condemnation, if he abide ſo, without remedy. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> but <hi>All condemnation</hi> to thoſe that are out of Chriſt Jeſus, as all unpardoned ſinners are; therefore tis a condition above all others to be weighed and conſidered, and not to be reſted in, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Neither the Prayers, nor Alms, nor any other duty of an unpardoned ſinner are; at all, accepted with the Lord.</hi> This, wretched ſinners will not admit of, but think if they perform any duty to God, he accepts of it, and that indeed it makes an atonement for their ſins; Take that one eminent place in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Though you make many prayers, yet I will not hear you;</hi> mark it, you that think becauſe you <hi>make, or ſay,</hi> as you ſtyle it, many good prayers, ſure God hears you; No, ſaith God, <hi>I will not hear,</hi> why, <hi>ſee verſe</hi> 16.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170425:10"/>
they were not <hi>waſhed</hi> from their ſins, therefore the Prophet calls them, to come to the Lord that they might be <hi>pardoned, verſe</hi> 38. Tis true, when a poor ſinner hath his heart ſmitten for ſin, and comes to the Lord, upon the account of promiſes, of grace and pardon through Jeſus Chriſt, with full purpoſe of heart to cleave unto the Lord, and ſo begs for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and all things that do accompany pardon and ſalvation, then God hears his cryes at the very firſt <hi>breathing</hi> of his ſoul; <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.56. but not till then, doth God regard the multitude of his Prayers, Alms, Worſhip, Keeping conſcience to men; therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if nothing be accepted with God, till in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned condition, ſuch an eſtate requires great and deep thoughts of heart of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Upon all this, it will follow. <hi>That an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned ſinner will have no other word from the Lord Jeſus Christ, at his coming, but, Go you curſed;</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting darkneſſe, and wrath and woes and all miſery muſt be his portion for ever. <hi>If he dye in his ſins,</hi> Joh. 8.29. his ſoul muſt be eternally damned without all Remedy; Live and dye unpardoned, and be damned unpardoned: When Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be come, neither he himſelf, nor Saint, nor Angel, will or can ſpeak one word, for a ſoul that dyes unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, though the ſoul ſcreek out for a drop of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it will be anſwered with nothing but the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes, of the ſcreekings of other deſperate ſouls, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be hurled with it, into the ſame everlaſting burnings; no eye to pitty there, though Miniſters and Saints did warn, invite, weep, mourn, pity, when on this ſide the grave, yet at the great Judgment, it will not be ſo. No, nothing but upbraidings of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, for neglecting Goſpel-grace, and refuſing the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170425:10"/>
termes of pardon, and for groſſe ſecurity; This will be the portion of every unpardoned ſinner, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the <hi>day</hi> of his ſalvation; Therefore the pardon of ſins requires the deepeſt thoughts of heart, and can never be made too ſure to a poor ſinfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If the pardon of ſin be of ſo great and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite weight, how doth this meet with the wretched deplorable careleſneſſe of a world of ſouls in this day, that think of nothing leſſe then <hi>whether their ſins are pardoned,</hi> that will hear of nothing that may call this great matter into queſtion, or way awaken them to it, Oh how many poor ſouls, (I fear too many of <hi>you,</hi> though ſo often and earneſtly preſt to it) that were never before the Lord <hi>mourning</hi> after the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your ſins? What a leight matter would it be to be pardoned, if there ſhould be no more in it, not care about it, then moſt ſinners, that call themſelves Chriſtians, make about it; Ah, ſinners, why do you make no more ado, no more matter of it; why ſo ſenſleſs of that, which is alone worthy all the thoughts of thy heart; if thou ſhouldſt live a million of years to diſpatch this one thing, to get thy ſins all pardoned. You that are <hi>Elderly</hi> people have a large reckoning, ſpecially upon your account of ſinning againſt Goſpell-light and grace; make haſte, what you do, do <hi>quickly, lay hold</hi> on eternall life: the ſun is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to let upon you, and wo with you, as ever you were men and women, if you fail of a good, and ſure diſpatch of this one corcernable thing, your ſins being pardoned; And you that are <hi>younger,</hi> take heed leſt the day of grace, <hi>ſet</hi> upon you, and you be <hi>given up</hi> to your own hearts luſts, and no word that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170425:11"/>
from God or man, ſhall ever <hi>reach</hi> you; Oh tremble at tryfling with convictions and light, but begin to honour the Lord Jeſus, and bow unto him, and wait for the promiſed effuſion of his ſpirit, and the joy of the Lord ſhall be the joy of your youth, and the love of the Lord will be very ſweet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>Exhort.</hi> Oh then let every ſoul of us be <hi>deeply</hi> affected with this weighty matter; let your ſouls ſay within you, Oh the dreadfulneſſe of an unpardoned condition? what tongue can expreſſe it? to have all my ſtore, (little or much), houſe, corn, cattle, all, under a curſe, and enjoy it as a curſe, and onely to further my eternall damnation! to be hated of the great God, and not loved, to be under all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law! where ever I read of wrath and wo, it belongs to me; to have not one of my prayers, or any thing elſe, accepted of the Lord! to be in a condition of expecting nothing from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt at his coming, but <hi>go ye curſed;</hi> when I ſhall ſee ſo many bleſſed ſouls that took paines for Heaven, enter into the Kingdome, and my ſelf ſhut out! Wo is me if I ſpeak peace to my ſoul in ſuch an eſtate, one moment more; <hi>Awake</hi> my ſoul, <hi>Awake.</hi> Away in to the bleſſed God for mercy, pardon, grace, Chriſt, his blood, ſpirit, holineſſe, eternall life; I will go, (the Lord helping me) and cry in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of my ſoul for them all; and if 'twere poſſible to weary the Lord with the cryes of my poor ſoul, I will do it, till he have mercy upon me, and bid me go in peace; The gracious God ſhall as hardly deny me, as ever he did any poor ſinner that lay bleeding at his feet for mercy and grace from heaven, to heale

a poor condemned ſoul; Oh what have I been doing in the world all this while? get a little ſomething, and my ſins unpardoned; in daily danger of dying in them, and ſo be loſt without all remedy for ever; Oh! ſuch will be the <hi>great thoughts</hi> of heart about the pardon of ſins, when the Lord ſhall ſpeak to a poor ſinner, and the Conſcience ſhall be thoroughly <hi>awake</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>Oh! let me yet, in the name of the Lord, argue out this matter with thee. Be <hi>ſerious</hi> for once, and <hi>ponder</hi> it in thy heart, what is health or wealth? what is it to have ſomething about thee in the world, &amp; lay up yearly, &amp; thou go deeper in debt with the juſt God every day?

What if all the world ſay of thee, Bleſſed; if God, and his holy Word of truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thee Curſed, becauſe thy ſins lye upon thy ſoul, and the Spirit of grace is not upon thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ah! poor Creature, Do not, do not, let thy ſins lye upon thy precious ſoul any longer, do not be contented to be a child of Gods wrath any longer; Oh! do not, thou poor careleſſe ſoul, if there be a ſpark of pity in thee; <hi>Do not,</hi> as the Devil flatters, reſt in this, and ſay, I <hi>hope</hi> better, and I <hi>hope</hi> 'tis better with me, and I <hi>hope</hi> I am or ſhall be pardoned, and ſo fall aſleep till thou drop into hell. You that think it an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie common matter to be pardoned, know not what it is, you have yet no part in this <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saith a poor convinced ſoul, 1. 'Tis a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that any ſinner in the world is pardoned, much more, ſuch a one as I, if ever I attain to it.</p>

The Lord can as freely let out love, full love, to his pardoned ones, as if they had never ſinned, becauſe he never looks upon them out of Chriſt; when God takes a poor ſinner to himſelf, he doth not barely and meerly pardon him, and ſave him from wrath, and no more, (as earthly Princes pardon many whom they <hi>love not</hi>) but God ſets his <hi>Love</hi> upon them, and it can never enter into his heart to hate them. <hi>He that loveth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be loved of my Father, Joh.</hi> 14.21. And if God afflict them, 'tis to make them better, more like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to beſtow more grace upon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. and Gods Love to his bleſſed children is like himſelf, <hi>Infinite, unmixt, everlaſting.</hi> This is another infinite bleſſing of pardoned ſouls, to be thus <hi>loved</hi> by their God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Pardoned ſouls are brought into a justified state, from which they ſhall never fall.</hi> Thus runs the tenour of the New Covenant, the bottome of all this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>I will remember their ſins no more, Heb.</hi> 8.12. — <hi>No more,</hi> Words of a ſweet and bleſſed ſound, to whom they are ſpoken by the Holy Ghoſt, that when poor ſouls that have come to Jeſus Chriſt, in a Goſpel way, for <hi>pardon,</hi> and have pleaded, and taken hold of promiſes of grace for that end, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unbelief is ſtirring. Oh! will not God, one time or other, call back to remembrance all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iniquities, and charge them upon me? No, ſaith the Lord, it ſhall never enter into my heart, I will remember them <hi>No More;</hi> Bleſſed words, and bleſt condition indeed. Ah! who would be without it?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170425:13"/>5. <hi>Pardoned ſouls, ſhall be kept in the hand of the Lord in all their wayes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.

Pſal.</hi> 97.10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. yea, he will keep them from evil, and nothing ſhall befall them but <hi>for their good. Rom.</hi> 8.28.

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Pardoned ſouls are Gods Heirs; Gal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>&amp;c.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If ſuch, and more then <hi>is</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be named, be the bleſſedneſs of pardoned ſouls, Ah! what poor ſecure ſinner (that muſt alſo be everlaſtingly damned without it) would <hi>miſs</hi> of it? Say ſinner, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curſed, hated, damned, and that for ever, for ever,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170425:14"/>
(for as is mercy and love to pardoned ones, ſo is wrath to ſuch as miſs of it, for ever) I ſay, inſtead of that, which any heart but what is plagued with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would melt and tremble at, to become a dear child of God, and have free acceſs to God, be loved of God, for ever juſtified, no ſin for ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred againſt thee, every thing befall thee for good, and be an Heir of God, and be even as bleſſed as God can make thee, and that for ever. Ah! where's the ſinner that would be without this? Who would ſleight that word of the Lord that would teach you, and lead you to this bleſſedneſs? Who would deſpiſe, or neglect the <hi>day</hi> of grace, now while within the reach of it? Who would run a dreadful hazzard of being given up of God, if you thus trifle with a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of ſalvation? Ah! the good Lord pity you that do thus; you are fit to be mourned over had we hearts to do it, with tears of blood. Yet once more, <hi>Awake, awake,</hi> you careleſs ones, before bodies drop into the grave, and ſouls into hell. Oh! do not do not take pleaſure in ſoul-murder; do not put off the one, only, main, neceſſary work, and leave it undone, till it may be impoſſible to have it done. Tell me in good earneſt, Canſt thou well be without the pardon of thy ſins here and for ever? Soul, thou mayſt well enough be without much Land, and much mony, and many great friends, and yet be well, exceeding well contented, nay better, if thou haſt Chriſt and grace then with them. But ſay canſt thou, canſt thou well be without the pardon of thy ſins? Canſt thou well <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> hated by the great and righteous God? Canſt thou well be where the fire is never quenched and the worm never dyes? Say, canſt thou well miſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170425:14"/>
the preſence of the ever bleſſed God to all eternity? Are damned ſcreeking Spirits good company for ever and ever? Away, away ſinner to the bleſſed God, betake thy ſelf (put it not off an hour longer) to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repenting, mourning to God for free pardon, for Chriſt, for the Spirit, and look up to the Lord to give thee a heart to do it, wait humbly, and carefully on the Goſpel of grace preached; and yet, though thou haſt hitherto been <hi>idle,</hi> thou mayeſt attain to this bleſſedneſs, as well as the bleſſedſt Saint in the world, if thou wilt be <hi>ſerious, diligent, earneſt,</hi> (as ſo weighty a matter requires) about it.

            <p n="2">2 <hi>Do not reſt in falſe evidences, falſe hopes of pardon.</hi> Many ſinners might ſeem to have got pardon, and gone well to Heaven, if they had not vainly and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly hoped ſo. Oh reſt in nothing, and never reſt without it (as I have preſſed thee in love) till thou canſt ſay, from a well grounded Goſpel-evidence, wrought forth with fear and trembling, Now I have the bleſſedneſs that accompanies pardoned ſouls: Now, oh <hi>now</hi> (rejoyce with me bleſſed ſouls) <hi>I am, I am</hi> a child of God, I <hi>have</hi> acceſs to the bleſſed God, and my ſoul pleads with him every day. Ah now, God, my God, <hi>doth</hi> love me; Now I am juſtified, in a ſtate of juſtification, from which my God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let me fall. Ah, my ſins, though great ſhall be remembred <hi>no more, no more;</hi> I ſhall be kept, <hi>ſafely</hi> kept, in all my waies; If I fall, the Lord will take me up, and I ſhall not utterly fall; however, it is, or may be with me as to the world and the things of it, I am <hi>rich</hi> (though poor, worthleſs, nothing in my ſelf,) with all the riches, unſearchable riches of

my Chriſt, I am an Heir of God; I need nothing. Oh, the ſweetneſs, peace, joy, contentment, Heaven of ſuch a bleſt, &amp; for ever bleſt condition! Now tell me ſinner (and let it ſtick with thee till thou art got well to Heaven) is not, is not, the pardon of thy ſins the work of the greateſt weight before thee on this ſide the grave? which is that I firſt promiſed thee to prove to thy Conſcience from the firſt Obſervation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I might from hence inſiſt to ſtir up poor ſouls, who have been awake for Heaven, and have been, and are crying and waiting for the pardon of your ſins, to be in this matter with <hi>all your might,</hi> becauſe you ſee 'tis wonderfully weighty and concernable to you, beyond all imaginations; get your <hi>doubts,</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>miſgivings of heart</hi> well removed; ſee from whence your doubts do ariſe, and follow them home to your hearts, and then be with the Lord much, and in his Word and Ordinances, till the Lord make it <hi>clear day</hi> in thy ſoul, and thou walk in a ſweet ſpirit of Adoption before him.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

               </p>
               <p>Pardon my iniquity for it is <hi>great, &amp;c.</hi> The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal word as well ſignifies <hi>Many,</hi> as <hi>Great,</hi> my ſins are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>many, Many great</hi> ſins lye upon me, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Oh pardon them, oh Lord, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus you have this bleſſed man <hi>David</hi> in ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> aggravating his ſin, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 38.4. <hi>Mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are gone over my head, and are a burden too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for me to bear; against thee only have I ſinned.

               <p>In the opening of this Point, firſt I would ſhew, <hi>Why,</hi> ſuch as come in a right way for pardon, do look upon their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How they come to ſee them ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170425:16"/>3. <hi>When</hi> a ſinner may be ſaid to have ſeen his ſins ſo great, as a pardoned ſoul ſhould do.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sinners that come to God for pardon and find it, do look upon their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins, <hi>becauſe againſt a great God, great</hi> in power, <hi>great</hi> in juſtice, <hi>great</hi> in holineſs; I am a worm, and yet ſin, and that boldly, againſt a God ſo <hi>great;</hi> for a worm to lift up himſelf againſt a great and infinite God; Oh this makes every little ſin <hi>great,</hi> and calls for <hi>great</hi> venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ſo great a God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they have ſinned againſt great patience,</hi> deſpiſing the goodneſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, which is call'd, <hi>treaſuring up of wrath, Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. Oh, ſaith a poor abaſed ſinner at Gods feet, How have I wearied the patience of God? <hi>I have not wearied thee,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>but thou haſt been weary of me, and haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with thine iniquities.

This greatens ſin to purpoſe to a poor ſoul that hath abuſed much patience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sins do appear great, becauſe againſt great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Oh againſt how many mercies and kindneſſes do ſinners ſin againſt, and turn all the mercies of God into ſin!

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170425:16"/>4. That which <hi>greatens</hi> ſin in the eyes of poor ſinners that cry for pardon, is, <hi>that they have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst great light,</hi> light in the Conſcience; this heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſin exceedingly, ſpecially to ſuch as are under Goſpel-means: and is indeed the ſin of all in this Nation; there's nothing more abaſeth a ſoul then this, nothing makes it more difficult to believe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when humbled for it: therefore 'tis, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor ſouls fear they have ſin'd the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they have ſinned againſt knowledge and light, which though while they are humbled before the Lord, it cannot be that they have ſo ſinned <hi>unpardonably;</hi> yet in as much as 'tis the ſin that borders next upon the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, it much <hi>greatens</hi> ſin to a poor ſoul under the ſenſe of it. Such a ſinner is ſaid to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Lord, Numb.</hi> 15.30; 31. <hi>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin; James</hi> 4. laſt. To him it is <hi>ſin,</hi> that is, <hi>great ſin,</hi> of which God will take the ſevereſt account: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as have the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and the knowledge of the Word in ſome meaſure, and yet go on unpenitently in ſin, they are the greateſt ſinners in the world, &amp; will have the greateſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And this circumſtance in ſin makes, or ſhould do ſo, ſuch ſouls that never lived in notorious ſins be under deep abaſement, becauſe, though their ſins were not ſo groſs, as many others, yet they were againſt <hi>great light,</hi> and knowledge, which makes every <hi>little</hi> ſin, continued in, <hi>great</hi> in the account of God, and great in the account of the ſinner, when he comes before the Lord in the ſenſe of it. Oh, I pleaſed my ſelf in ſins that I <hi>knew</hi> to be ſins, and was convinced
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170425:17"/>
by the word of God of them; yet I went on, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them;</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Continuance in ſin, much greatens ſin to a poor ſoul that is after pardon;</hi> ſpecially ſuch as are not very early converted. <hi>God will wound the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one that goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes. Pſal.</hi> 68.21. Oh, I added ſin unto ſin, ſaith a poor ſoul, ſpending the choiſe time of my youth in ſin, when I might have been getting the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and honouring of God. This lay cloſe upon <hi>David's</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as appears in this 25th. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7. <hi>Oh remember not the ſins of my youth, &amp;c.</hi> Yet we do not find that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> youth was notoriouſly ſinful; but in as much as he ſpent not his youth to get knowledge, and to ſerve the Lord fully, 'twas his burden and complaint before the Lord; much more ſuch whoſe youth was ſpent in nothing but vanity, prophaneſs, lying, ſwearing, prophaning of the Sabbath, ſports, paſtimes, exceſs of riot, and the like, when God layes it in upon their conſciences, muſt be grievous and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Multitudes of ſins do make ſin appear great;</hi> this made <hi>David</hi> cry out for <hi>multitude of mercies, Pſa.</hi> 51. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up; they are more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> One ſin, but a ſinfull thought, is worthy of a thouſand hells, much more, multiplyed, numberleſs, infinite ſins, in thought, words, walkings, calling, worſhip, in all I have done, I did nothing elſe but ſin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leaſt ſinner in the world is a great ſinner, when God lays his <hi>account</hi> before him.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170425:17"/>7. Another thing that <hi>greatens</hi> ſin is, <hi>that it was againſt purpoſes and reſolutions of forſaking ſuch and ſuch ſins;</hi> and yet all broken, ſometimes againſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vowes, againſt prayers: this conſideration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many a poor ſoul ſticks hard, and layes low, and makes his ſin grievous indeed, that againſt purpoſes, vowes, prayers, he ſhould return to his ſin; this makes him cry out, Oh my ſin is <hi>great, great</hi> indeed, Doth, will, the Lord pardon ſuch a wretch? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sin appears <hi>great</hi> when ſeen by a poor ſoul, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was reigning ſin, Rom.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Sin reigned to death, &amp;c.</hi> Oh, ſaith a poor humbled ſinner, I did not only <hi>commit</hi> ſin, but I was the <hi>ſervant</hi> and <hi>ſlave</hi> of ſin, I obey'd ſin as a lord, and that <hi>willingly,</hi> I obey'd it in the luſts thereof; where God, Chriſt, his Spirit, Word, Law, ſhould have dwelt and reigned, there ſin and luſts bore ſway, and had the command of my ſoul. A little ſin when a <hi>reigning</hi> ſin, is a great ſin. All that ſin can do is but to rule the ſinner, and ſo it doth the leaſt ſinner that is under it, though it break not forth into groſſe notorious actings againſt the Lord, and this doth much greaten it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Sin in the fountain makes it great;</hi> As it may be ſaid, there is more water in the fountain, then in the pools and ſtreams it makes; becauſe there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual iſſuing and flowing out of it, which is able to make far greater ſtreams: ſo ſin in the nature, in the heart, is there as in the fountain, and therefore 'tis more there than in the breakings forth of it in the outward man; ſo that, though a ſinner in his youth hath been reſtrained from many great ſins, yet in as much, as ſin in the fountain was as full as in any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the world, though reſtrained &amp; pent in, (which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170425:18"/>
the ſinner was not beholding to his own heart for) it renders him a <hi>great</hi> ſinner before the Lord, when ſavingly enlightned. The want of this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes outwardly righteous perſons not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as great ſinners; they ſee and feel not ſin infinite in the fountain of it, which moſtly grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it, above all the actings of it in life.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A ſinner drawing nigh to God for pardon, ſees his ſin as <hi>great, becauſe thereby he was led captive by the Devil at his will; He that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>comitteth</hi> ſin, ſo as in a ſtate of ſin, under the power of ſin, and not born of God; why, ſuch a one <hi>is of the Devil,</hi> under the power of the Devil; of the Devil and not of God; and this becauſe of ſin, which gives this dominion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Oh, ſaith a poor Creature, I that was the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and ſhould have lived to him, lived to the Devil, and the ſervice of him; and took part with him, againſt Chriſt, his Word, his Saints, and was an enemy to them: this greatens my ſin before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Sin appears <hi>great, becauſe great is the wrath of God againſt ſin;</hi> ſinners are ſaid <hi>to heap up wrath, Rom.</hi> 2. and they are called the <hi>Children of wrath.</hi> God to manifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt ſin, is fain to powre out everlaſting wrath upon an unpardoned ſinner, to leave the ſinner under endleſs torment of ſoul and body. God hates nothing but ſin, and for ſin, and ſo hates it, that infinite endleſs wrath muſt be the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of it. Oh, when God gives a ſinner a glimpſe of this! Oh the greatneſs of every little ſin to deſerve ſuch wrath! How ſhall I flee from and eſcape the wrath to come? who can ſtand before ſuch wrath, who can bear it?</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170425:18"/>12. The way of any ſinner's deliverance from ſuch wrath, ſhews ſin to be exceeding <hi>great, in the price and ranſome that is paid for the ſalvation of him from his ſins,</hi> the price of the blood of the eternal ſon of God. How great was ſin, how ſinful and damnable the nature of it in the eye of the righteous God, when juſtice could not be ſatisfied but by ſuch a way? Oh, ſaith a poor ſoul that comes for pardon, what a damnable thing is ſin, which was once nothing to me, that redemption from it is at ſuch a rate! God had no greater a price to give, then what he layd down to ſave a wretched ſinner from his ſin. Oh, 'twas great ſin that muſt crucifie the Lord of life and glory: therefore doth my ſoul hate it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Laſtly, This conſideration alſo <hi>greatens</hi> ſin, in- as much as a poor creature hath drawn and tempted others to ſin with him, ſpecially ſuch as have lived more vainly &amp; looſly, &amp; it lies hard upon many a poor ſoul after thorough conviction. Oh, how many have I drawn to ſin, not only by my example, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and perſwaſion, that may be now in hell for ſuch ſins, or are under a ſtate of impenitency, and hardned by me. Oh this is an abaſing conſideration, to a poor convinced, humbled ſinner, when God ſmites his heart with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Before we go further, let us labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to the conſciences of all. I have ſhewed you, the matter we are upon, is the weightieſt that ever took up Gods heart, the pardoning of a ſinner; and therefore, how ſhould it ſwallow up the hearts of poor undone ſouls that are ſo infinitely concern'd in it (I beſeech you therefore, lay to your hearts what

hath been ſpoken as to the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ſin; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, If ſouls that come to God by Chriſt for pardon, ſee their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins, and 'tis their great trouble that they cannot ſee them greater;</p>
               <p>Firſt then, This may ſerve to take off that woful deceit of heart, and deluſion of the Devil of poor careleſs ſouls that dream of pardon, and yet never in any meaſure thus ſaw their ſins as great; This ſhews the heart was never touched of God, never ſmitten for ſin as yet; This is the way indeed of unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinners, they are <hi>leſſening</hi> their ſins to God and themſelves, finding out circumſtances to <hi>leſſen</hi> them, of others tempting them, and the Devil, and the like, and, many or moſt of men or women allow themſelves in the ſame, or they were overtaken, or the like; they think they can eaſily pacifie God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that God makes not ſo great a matter of it; thus a deceitful heart and a cheating Devil juggle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſooth Conſcience in a damnable peace; And ſuch ſouls call their great reigning ſins their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> and God will not be ſo exact, as ſome of the Preachers make him; here's a ſinner riverted in a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate. But now take a ſoul whom God (as I ſhall ſhew) hath made ſenſible of ſin, and the weight of pardon, and comes to the feet of the Lord for it; 'tis quite otherwiſe. Oh, my ſins, wretch that I was and am, were little ſins to me before, but now they are great ſins; I called it my <hi>infirmity</hi> to lye, ſwear, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Sabboth, allow my ſelf in any exceſs; but now I ſee 'twas reigning ſin, ſoul-damning ſin, great, oh great ſin; Oh that I am out of hell! Oh the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God! Is there mercy for ſuch a wretch? What a wonder will it be if I get to Heaven? How
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170425:19"/>
great will that mercy be that pardons me?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore, in the ſecond place, <hi>examine how it is with you?</hi> and whether you have had ſome ſuch workings of heart; Have you been before the Lord in <hi>David's</hi> poſture, Oh, <hi>mine iniquity is great,</hi> Oh I have ſinned againſt a great God, wearied great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, turned great mercies into ſin. Oh I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt great light, How ſhall I be pardoned? Sins continued in, and multiplyed from my youth up, and theſe againſt ſerious purpoſes, under the reign of it; there's an infinite fountain of all evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. If I have been any way reſtrained, no thanks to my own heart for it. Oh, ſaith a poor ſoul, I was led by the Devil, befool'd by the Devil, ſerved the Devil againſt God; And now, what can I challenge at the hands of God? What belongs to me but wrath, great wrath, everlaſting wrath, infinite wrath? If one ſin deſerves a thouſand hells, what do innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable tranſgreſſions do? If mercy be not infinite, how ſhall I look up to God, or how ſhall God look down upon me? Oh, I ſay, let your Conſcience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; hath it been thus, in ſome good and <hi>real</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though not ſo <hi>deep</hi> as your ſoul deſires. I know there are degrees, and I alſo know till God come to let out Himſelf in ſuch a way as this, that ſin is ☞ <hi>great,</hi> and greater in mine eye then ever, we make but ſlight work of it in out ſpirits: want of this makes many in theſe dayes run away with pleaſant notions of Grace, Chriſt, Light, (though bleſſed be the Lord for ever, for the more glorious Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe, but I ſpeak of abuſes) but <hi>ſin</hi> was never <hi>great</hi> by the appearance of God, and ſo they wanton with ſuch <hi>notions</hi> which at laſt weare off,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170425:20"/>
and ſo they come to nothing, but a reproach to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third place, therefore, let it ſerve to <hi>exhort</hi> ſinners to look back upon your lives, even from your <hi>youth</hi> up: you may find one more of the diſcoveries mentioned of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of ſin, that you will fall under; ſpecially ſuch as have bin given to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe and vanities of the age you live in, lying, ſwearing, profaning of the Sabbath, to riot, ungodly paſtimes and ſports, reviling the godly, or other more ſecret wickedneſſes and pollutions; any of which may be ſpeak thee in a ſtate of ſin and wrath, joyned with thy living in the neglect of known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, upon which neglect God hath pronounced a <hi>curſe,</hi> as the neglect of ſecret or Family-prayer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if thou haſt not been engaged in groſſe ſins, but haſt bin ſober and well carriaged from thy youth up, yet thou mayſt be ſtill in <hi>a state</hi> of ſin, but go a little more ſoberly to hell, and in more danger of being damned in thy civill ſober carriage then great ſinners; with which thou art apt to compare thy ſelf, and ſeeing thy ſelf not ſo bad as them, thinkeſt all is well; But remember well, what hath bin proved, that ſin is greater in the Fountain, then the ſtreames, though it make a greater noiſe or ſhew to others in the ſtreame of ones life; thou haſt a Hell in thy nature, an infinite fountaine of any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that ever any of the Sons or Daughters of men did commit, An Idolater, An Adulterer, A Murderer, A Sodomite, A devil in thy heart and whole frame, thy nature; In a word, one ſin, which thou callſt little, reigning but in thy heart, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170425:20"/>
there is enough to ſend thee to hell, as if thou wert the veryeſt reprobate living. Remember, the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> that thought himſelf a blameleſſe man, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.6. afterwards cryes out, of <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſinfulneſſe, Rom.</hi> 7.13. yea the greateſt, the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. But I hope to meet with thee, and with thy conſcience, as to this conviction, more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The next inquiry will be, <hi>when</hi> a poor ſoul may be ſaid to be under ſuch a diſcovery of the <hi>greatnes</hi> of ſin, as may lead him to get pardon through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One diſcovery I have named already; which is, <hi>ſuch a ſoul doth not go about to leſſen his ſin, but greaten it to his greater abaſement;</hi> tis his fear he doth not ſee his ſin <hi>great</hi> enough, to lay him low enough before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When ſuch a ſight and diſcovery of ſin, <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets trouble upon the ſpirit;</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. you have <hi>David</hi> under a great diſcovery of ſin, and he cryes out, <hi>there is no rest in my bones, becauſe of my ſin, I am troubled, I am bowed down, I go mourning all the day;</hi> ſuch a trouble, that will not admit of peace and healing but from Jeſus Chriſt, till it can take hold of Jeſus Chriſt in a promiſe of grace and pardon, and come to him, and cloſe with him, to be juſtified and Sanctified by him and in him; as I am at large to ſhew, if God will. I ſpeak this, becauſe there is a trouble for ſin, that often ends in a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous peace: many poor creatures have for a time bin troubled for ſin, and they have made one ſhift or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quiet themſelves, it may be leave their ſins, and do a little ſomething more, but never come in a Goſpel way to Chriſt; which I am alſo (through
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170425:21"/>
grace) to evidence in the diſcovery of a falſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. However, ſo it is, that every ſoul that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottomed from a falſe peace, a peace in ſin, or his duties, he comes under trouble, more or leſſe, in and for his ſin, as he gets to pardon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God ſmites a ſoul for ſome ſpeciall particular ſin;</hi> Jer. 3.13. <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou haſt tranſgreſſed against the Lord thy God, and haſt ſcattered thy wayes under every green tree,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Generall</hi> acknowledgment of ſins, comes to nothing, 'tis the the note of a Hypocrite; but <hi>particular</hi> ſins lying upon the ſoul, ſpeak forth ſpirituall convictions, when joyned, I mean, with other workings of heart we are now ſetting forth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As God ſmites, <hi>ſo the ſinner is in particular confeſſion before the Lord,</hi> loads his heart with ſin, till it breaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But who will not confeſſe himſelf a ſinner, you will ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly few, in a Scripture ſaving ſenſe; A word or two more to this; That confeſſion of ſin before the Lord is a duty, and ſuch as hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of forgiveneſſe of ſin, (the iſſue of all we are driving at), ſuch places of Scripture will clear, Pſal. 32. <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne;</hi> Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall find mercy; If we confeſſe our ſins he is faithfull and juſt, to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 John 1.9. This being a duty to which ſo bleſſed promiſes are annexed, 'tis of much concernment to ſouls that are very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious about forgiveneſſe to have it ſtated aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170425:21"/>
to Scripture and ſaving Experience.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin, that doth not entitle to the promiſe; which a hypocrite may reach to; ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 9.27. <hi>I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked;</hi> here's confeſſion but no pardon; ſo <hi>Judas,</hi> Math. 27.3, 4. <hi>I have ſinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;</hi> ſo <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>I have ſinned, for I have tranſgreſſed the Commandement of the Lord;</hi> Here are verball inforced confeſſions when the hand of God was upon them, and yet did not end in mercy.</p>
               <p>The confeſſion of a Hypocrite proceeds only from judgment felt or feared; but that which is ſincere and ends in mercy &amp; pardon, goes upon better grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As firſt, <hi>Confeſſion that hath the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is accompanied with hatred of ſin.</hi> So in that bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed draught of the new Covenant, Ezek. 36. <hi>I will ſave you from your uncleanneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. verſe 29. and verſe 31. <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abominations. Then,</hi> when God comes in a way of mercy and pardon, then, God will make them <hi>remember</hi> their wickedneſſes, that they had even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and had thought that God had forgotten them alſo: they thought they were <hi>good</hi> ways before, but now the Lord ſhews them they were <hi>not good,</hi> and they <hi>loath</hi> themſelves: ſin is not onely a <hi>terrour,</hi> but a <hi>loathſome</hi> thing to them, hateful to the ſoul that is under this conviction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whence, <hi>ſecondly, Saving confeſſion reſpects the pollution of ſin. They ſhall loath themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170425:22"/>
open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee;</hi> In that 38. <hi>Pſal. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is in ſelf-loathing; this doth ariſe (as preſently I ſhall ſhew) from a glimpſe of Gods holineſs, which I humbly conceive, ☞No reprobate in the world doth reach to; to loath ſin becauſe it makes him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It followes therefore that ſuch <hi>confeſſion drives ſin to the root, to the fountain,</hi> there ſees it moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, odious, infinite. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. A Hypocrites confeſſion ends in outward groſſe ſins, from terrour onely, and reacheth not to heart-ſin, pollution of nature; and if he can reach to reforme ſuch outward groſſe ſins, he hath done, as he thinks, the utmoſt, but never comes to loath, (and ſo to mortifie, through the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit), ſin at the root: but ſincere ſouls, touched by the holy Ghoſt, with a ſaving ſenſe of ſin, do drive ſin home to its originall, to its root, in the univerſall corruption of heart and nature, and there the ſevereſt edge and indignation againſt it, is let forth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Brokeneſs of heart for ſin is an effect of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> Pſal. 51, 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57, 15. And this ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon ſenſe of Gods patience, goodneſs, love; As hatred of the pollution of ſin, ariſeth from a ſight of Gods holines; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cryes out, he had ſinned when he ſmarted with puniſhment, but was ſtill under the plague of his hard heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27, <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. There is indeed, a kind of brokenneſſe that the hammerings of terrour, by puniſhments, or by the word, may worke, which may a little wear and rough-hew the heart, and yet go no further, but yet leave the heart
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170425:22"/>
under its naturall <hi>hardneſſe,</hi> but now that which is the ſpirits ſaving work kindly melts the heart, makes it ſoft, and ſo it can <hi>powre</hi> out it ſelf to God, as a thing melted, in heart-melting confeſſions; at leaſt, the poor ſoul, mourns over the hardneſſe of its heart, oh that I have thus ſinned, and yet my heart will not break? bleſſed be every ſtroak, and every word of God, and every Ordinance, that, though grace, breaks my heart more; A ſincere ſoul ſets a high price upon brokenneſſe, and yet reſts not in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Such confeſſion that hath the promiſe is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſoul-abaſement; He that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luke 18.14. ſpoken upon the Publicans acceptance with God in his confeſſion, under brokeneſſe, <hi>ſmiting upon his breaſt,</hi> and deep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement, <hi>not lifting up his eyes to heaven:</hi> So that great promiſe, 2 Chron. 7.14. <hi>If my people ſhall humble themſelves, and pray and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear from Heaven, &amp; will forgive their ſins;</hi> This a work of the narroweſt ſearch of any other. I intend, if the Lord will, to ſpeak to this more diſtinctly and fully, in another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Only now a word of ſuch a humiliation as is joyned with ſuch confeſſion, that hath the promiſe of pardon, which is the ſcope we drive at.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the ſoul is in confeſſion, and under the Lords <hi>humblings</hi> in order to pardon, <hi>The poor Creature acknowledgeth himſelf infinitely unworthy that ever the Lord ſhould caſt a look upon him, or give out mercy and pardon to him:</hi> This concluſion is fixed upon the ſoul, and the ſoul falls down abaſed in the ſence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170425:23"/>
of it, what ever the Lord do with me, I will lay my mouth in the duſt, I am worthy of <hi>nothing</hi> from the Lord, but a thouſand Hells; this <hi>quiets the heart</hi> in ſome meaſure, what ever the pleaſure of the Lord be towards him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the poor ſinfull Creature is worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>ſo he will give glory to God, if God never pardon;</hi> God is never the leſſe righteous, or holy, wiſe, or good, if he never let out one drop of mercy upon ſo vile a Creature: yet he is a God bleſſed for ever; <hi>Thou art holy,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.3. <hi>But I am a worme, and no man,</hi> verſe 6. A worm ſit for God, and man to tread upon, and yet muſt not riſe up againſt God, nor ſay to him, what doſt thou? <hi>no Man:</hi> I have un-man'd my ſelf with ſin, I am duſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf, <hi>vile</hi> duſt; that's my make, my frame: oh I muſt give glory to his juſtice, though I periſh for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The poor Creature hath no good, no not the leaſt, to procure pardon, or to move God to pardon,</hi> Pſal. 14.3. Saith, a poor humbled ſoul treating for pardon, if mercy and pardon muſt come forth upon termes of my good, having or doing any thing, but what hath infinitely ſin enough in it to damn me for ever; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to Hell I muſt: No, ſin enough to ſend a world of ſouls to Hell, but not a drop of good to move the Lord to mercy. If God give our mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſight of good, I exſpect not a drop from him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It followes from hence when a ſinner comes humbled, <hi>he comes as nothing elſe but a ſinner:</hi> Luke 18.13. <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> one, thats nothing elſe but a wretched ſinner, for ſo the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can means it, as in a contrary frame to the Phariſee,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170425:23"/>
who thanks God that he was not ſo bad as many were, though the Phariſee no doubt would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome ſin, but now the Publican is <hi>All a ſinner,</hi> in as bad a condition as any ſinner in the world: ☞ Here's a <hi>touchſtone:</hi> poor ſouls in theſe dayes, they hope they have not ſo much need of Chriſt, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ſinners, they be not <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but ſinners, they have or do ſome good; The diſcuſſion of this, will be the next diſcourſe, only now a word more; Know ſinner, that one ſin ſtrikes off all thy pretended good, as ſhall at large, through mercy, be proved to thee: ſtick to one drop of good in thee or from thee, when thou comeſt for mercy and pardon, and thou loſeſt all: oh to be <hi>wholly</hi> condemned, <hi>wholly</hi> unrighteous, <hi>wholly</hi> a ſinner, is a great work; tis the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing conviction of any other. While a man hath any thing to live upon, he is not fit to beg; ſo while a ſoul hath a drop of any thing, that in his own ſenſe, may the more admit him to pardon, he cannot have it. Take it thus: If one came to your doors and beg, and he hath good Cloaths on his back, and he ſhould ſay, I have good Cloaths on my back, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my own, therefore I pray Give me: would you not anſwer, if you have ſomething of your own, &amp; are pretty well cloathed, why ſhould you beg; tis not for you to come and ask almes? But if a poor naked wretch come, and ſay &amp; cry: oh I am a poor creature, a poor naked deſtitute creature, I have nothing, all's gone, I have loſt all, pray cover me, pray feed me, out of great pity; you will look upon ſuch a poor wretch, and do ſomething for him, if you have any bowels; So, if a ſinner, (as that Phariſee did) come and ſay, Lord I have done this and this, I have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170425:24"/>
not been ſo wicked as many, I do ſome good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon; that <hi>therefore</hi> will make the Lord ſend thee away without mercy: no ſaith God, live upon what thou haſt, if thou haſt any thing; Oh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thou art not fit to beg, (to beg mercy and pardon) till thou haſt juſt nothing of thy own: which the naturall pride of thy heart will very hardly come off to.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the way of mens tribunalls of Juſtice, and Courts of life and death; If a Malefactor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, and he yet plead, Though I am proved a thief or a murderer, yet I have kept the reſt of the Law, I have broken no Law of the Nation that deſerves death beſide, ſhall not this rather juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy me, then this crime condemn me; No, ſaith the Judge, That's nothing to us, though thou haſt kept the Law in other things, thou muſt dye by the Law, as a trangreſſour of it, for this thou haſt done: why then, ſaith the condemned perſon, I muſt plead all mercy. Juſt ſo it is at the tribunal of God; comes a poor ſoul that is convinced he hath ſinn'd, oh but ſaith he in his heart, I have kept the Law in many or moſt things, will not that commend me to God? will not God look upon my good more then my evil? No, ſaith God in his word, thou haſt broken the Law, and thou art curſed, therefore the Law can ſhew thee no mercy, I can take no notice of any of thy pretended keeping of it in any other thing; oh then, muſt a poor ſinner ſay, then it muſt be all, all of mercy, if I am ever pardoned; this may be enough to diſcover ſuch a humiliation that follows confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hath the promiſe of pardon, and doth alſo further evidence the main point, which is to ſet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170425:24"/>
forth, when a Sinner ſo ſees his ſin, as <hi>great ſin</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pardon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. One thing more, which I ſhall but mention; ſuch a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin as hath the promiſe of <hi>mercy,</hi> is accompanied with a firm reſolution, through grace, to <hi>forſake</hi> ſin, every ſin, in heart and life; <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. <hi>as before.</hi> Mark well that famous promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon;</hi> here's forſaking wayes and thoughts; ſins of heart and life, and not a forſaking or leaving of ſome great ſins, but forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and warring againſt a ſinfull diſpoſition, ſinfull thoughts, and not onely a mere leaving of ſin, but a <hi>returning</hi> to the Lord, which he cannot do, if held under the love of but one ſin; and a turning to God only upon the account of free mercy, and then God <hi>abundantly</hi> pardons: A good word ſuited to a poor ſoul, under the ſenſe of ſinning <hi>abundantly,</hi> therefore need of <hi>abundance</hi> of mercy and pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Therefore the next Uſe will be, of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Have you bin under ſuch a <hi>trouble,</hi> as before opened, about ſin and the pardon of it? ſuch a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that would not be quieted but by claſping about Jeſus Chriſt; hath the Lord ſmitten you with the deep ſenſe of a particular ſin, your boſome ſin, and thereby bin brought to a <hi>deep</hi> ſenſe of the evil of <hi>all</hi> ſin? Have you been upon your knees, your faces, in as <hi>particular</hi> a confeſſion as your could, <hi>hating, loathing,</hi> ſin and your ſelves in it? Oh have you driven ſin to the root, the fountain! oh there's a Hell of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170425:25"/>
Say, do you know what it is to have broken hearts under the weight of ſin, and the ſenſe of the patience, grace, and love of God, held forth to you in Jeſus Chriſt. Do you know what <hi>ſoul-abaſement</hi> is, acknowledging in confuſion of face, that you are worthy of nothing from the Lord for ever? not ſo much as a glimpſe of mercy, a good look from him, becauſe you have ſo ſinned againſt him? Have you glorified God though he never pardon you? and is he holy and bleſſed, though you are baniſhed from him for ever? Have you been ſo reduced to ſee that there's not the leaſt atome of good to commend you to the Lord? and ſo layn down as <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but a ſinnerr before him? Thouſands of ſins to damne thee, but not a drop of righteouſneſſe to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee; and ſo creep to the ſeat of mercy, infinite, free mercy? yea haſt thou ſeen and felt the difficulty of ſuch a ſelf-emptines, that thou wouldſt rather part with all thy ſinne, then thy righteouneſſe; yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be righteous and holy, than be humble and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty; ☞ A poor ſoul would take up from ſin, upon conviction of the damnableneſſe of it, and be more righteous and holy, but to be reduced firſt to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nothing elſe but a poor, vile, unrighteous, weak, empty creature, and ſo to Chriſt; here the pride of heart ſticks. Now ſoul, be narrow and cloſe in the ſearch of this; for faile here, and fail in all. But I intend a larger diſcourſe to further this Conviction.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Let it exhort you that have never bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any <hi>trouble</hi> about your ſin and the pardon of it, that you do dot <hi>ward</hi> off, and get from under ſuch convincing, ſearching, words that may trouble you:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170425:25"/>
many poor ſinfull Creatures reſolve they will never hearken to ſuch a word as ſhall <hi>trouble</hi> them; and cannot bear ſuch preaching as would <hi>trouble</hi> their conſciences; One word with you; Why ſoul, Haſt thou bin diſhonouring God, abuſing his patience and mercy, tranſgreſſing his holy Commands, ſlighting his grace, and yet thou muſt not be <hi>troubled</hi> for it? wilt thou have thouſands of ſins upon thy ſoul, unpardoned, and tread upon the brink of Hell every ſtep thou goeſt, and not be <hi>troubled</hi> about it? It ſeems then thou reſolveſt not to trouble thy ſelf much about that petty buſineſſe (as thou makeſt it) of being damned for ever, or ſaved for ever? No, nothing about ſin, guilt, pardon, heaven, and hell, muſt trouble thee? Alas, poor deluded creature, what a care is there to get to hell peaceably; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any one got to heaven ſo, that was never <hi>troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> about getting his ſins pardoned: Away, away with ſuch a curſed peace, and let it now trouble thee that thou haſt put off this work ſo long, that ſin and thy ſoul have bin at ſuch a peace ſo long. Be now at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed war againſt it, and take part with the Lord and his word, that is teaching thee how yet to arive at the bleſſed haven of peace, not with ſin, but with the bleſſed God, againſt whom thou haſt ſo greatly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Oh look unto him to ſmite a hard ſecure heart, to ſtrike at a boſome helliſh luſt, for whoſe peace thou haſt ſo long, and ſo fooliſhly contended: yea go in ſecret, and fall down before the great God, particularly confeſſing and ſhaming thy ſelf, haring, loathing, humbling, till thou cry out, as <hi>David</hi> here, Oh pardon; what a great matter tis for any poor ſoul to be pardoned? Now, great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170425:26"/>
for a great ſinner, or I am loſt for ever. Out-ſinned pardon thou haſt not, if thou comeſt in this poſture to God for it.</p>
               <p>But you may further enquire, how doth God bring a poor ſoul to this paſſe, to ſuch a deep ſenſe of ſin, ſuch a ſight of himſelf, ſo as to be thus before the the Lord, in ſelf-loathing, and abaſement. I intend alſo, if God will, a fuller and ſet-diſcourſe as to this matter: Only now a word; (1.) When a ſoul is brought to this paſſe, God lets out an <hi>appearance</hi> of himſelf in meaſure, upon a poor creature, ſuch a glimpſe of light and purity, that makes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fall down, and cry out, oh I am vile, vile as the duſt I tread on? (2.) God gives out his <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the word, which convinceth, and ſearcheth the ſoul, ſhewes it its condition, ſtate, ſin, the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and pollution of it, the greatneſſe of it, as was ſhewed: The ſpirit opens the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. and ſhewes the ſinner as in glaſſe what he is; The ſpirit gives a ſight of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt peirced with the ſins of ſuch as will come unto him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Theſe do cauſe loathing and bitterneſſe upon the ſoul of a poor ſinner, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the Lord for pardon.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis great wiſdome to be where God ſpeakes, where God appeares, where God gives out his ſpirit, which is uſually in the word preacht powerfully, among the Saints meetings; or ſetting thy ſelf in ſecret to muſe and ponder about an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition, or when the afflicting hand of God is upon thee; do not ſay, I am <hi>not ſo great</hi> a ſinner as to make ſo much a do about pardon, or heaven, if that be thy temper, thou art the moſt likely to be in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170425:26"/>
the road-way of hell, in a peace that will end in woes and ſorrows, of any ſoul in the world. Oh wait for Gods appearance, and every little ſin will be great, a hell of ſin within thee, though outwardly civil and ſober; wait for the Spirit in the Word, and go, and pray for it. 'Tis one thing to know ſin by the Letter of the Law, which commands this, and forbids that, and another thing to know, ſee, feel ſin, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil of it, the exceeding ſinfulneſs and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by the conviction of the Spirit; ſo as to ſee it moſt in the fountain, in thy nature, and there loath and bewail it, becauſe it makes thee unclean, and unholy, and unlike God, and unfit for God and holy communion with him: which is the way and moſt certain evidence of the Spirits ſaving convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, (as diſtinguiſhing from that which a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may have) and carries a ſoul to the fountain opened, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. that its iniquity may be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly cleanſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. If ſinners that come to God for mercy &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſee their ſin as <hi>great,</hi> then it will alſo follow that <hi>great</hi> ſinners may be pardoned &amp; ſaved; You that are great ſinners, old ſinners, Oh hearken to this, you are yet within the reach of grace, and mercy, and pardon, if you will come to Jeſus Chriſt for it, the greatneſs of your ſin is no barr to you; but, if you fail of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 'tis becauſe you will not come to Chriſt for it, and accept it upon Goſpel-terms; you will not have pardon with a new heart and new life; or you make a ſlight matter of pardon, or you think 'twill come of courſe; or you are afraid to enter into a ſerious review and debate with your ſelves, becauſe your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170425:27"/>
ſins are <hi>ſo great,</hi> they will terrifie you, or take you off your pleaſure and peace of your minds, and joy in the world; Away, away, with any of theſe pleas; though, thou haſt ſinned much, greatly, long, with all thy might, come to Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; thoſe great ſins are no more before his blood to waſh them away then the leaſt ſin (if any be little) that ever was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pardoned, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.18. Do not hence ſay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, Oh 'tis well, that great ſinners may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I ever thought ſo, what need ſo much ado? Do not thus harden thy ſelf, and make ſuch a curſed uſe of ſo bleſſed a truth; but therefore come in, lay down thy weapons with which thou haſt been figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt God; Wilt thou hold up rebellion, and yet cry pardon? Is it equitable thou ſhouldſt expect it? No, fall down at the feet of that God againſt whom thou haſt ſo <hi>greatly</hi> ſinned, in the poſture hath been ſhewed thee; and then though <hi>ſin hath abounded, yet grace doth much more abound, Rom.</hi> 5. laſt. <hi>Great</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have become <hi>great</hi> Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you?</hi> who were they? Idolaters, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, Revilers, Sodomites, &amp;c. and ſuch like. You that have been ſuch like, God may have as much glory in your pardon, as he hath had diſhonour by your ſin: only be not ſuch a <hi>Devil</hi> to thy ſelf, as to turn thy back upon it, and when thou haſt thus long rebelled, to tell God, he muſt ſtay thy leaſure for thy acceptance of his pardon, thy ſins are too ſweet to leave as yet; I tell thee, ſoul, and I have ſhew'd it, that Gods pardons coſt him dear, and are precious; and if thou deal thus, they may be lockt up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from thy wretched ſoul to all eternity. Who, but a deſperate wretch, but would take mercy and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170425:27"/>
grace from Heaven, that may make him bleſſed for ever, when God offers it, by his dear Son, let thy ſins be never ſo great? why, wretched man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Haſt thou not done God wrong enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,! but muſt thou ſtay yet longer in thy curſed ſin, and wrong him yet more? Haſt not done enough already to damn a thouſand ſouls, but wouldſt do more, and make as ſure of hell as thou canſt? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſinner, great ſinner, young or old, do not put me off, nay, do not put the Lord off, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in his hand, a promiſe of grace ready to be ſealed by the Holy-ghoſt; if thou wilt now, from thy ſoul, readily ſay, why then, be it ſo, Lord Jeſus I come to thee; If the tearms be leaving all this deceitful ſin, and to be made like unto thee, be it ſo, I accept of it, tear my luſts from my heart, I have ſerved them long enough, too long; Oh now, if there be any mercy in Heaven let me have it, ſave me, (not in,) but <hi>from</hi> my ſins; Oh Lord, for they are <hi>great, great</hi> indeed; <hi>I will, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and he ſpeaks it in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29. <hi>I will ſave you from all your uncleaneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> 'tis as much as if the Lord ſhould have now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from Heaven: mark every tittle in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe! Now thou cryeſt, Oh, <hi>will, will</hi> the Lord ſave? <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith the Lord; Oh but, will he ſave me <hi>from</hi> ſuch <hi>uncleanneſſes,</hi> yea, from uncleanneſſes; what from <hi>All?</hi> yea, from <hi>All</hi> thy uncleanneſſes; fall down and Adore, and cry out, Oh grace, free, rich, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, glorious grace; admire Angels, Saints, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Behold one of Gods wonders, <hi>A great ſinner ſaved.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 7. And ſo ſeventhly, it may ſerve to exhort <hi>bleſſed</hi> ſouls brought into a ſtate of peace and pardon,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170425:28"/>
ſtill to keep an eye upon the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of mercy; If mercy were not great, how could any ſin be forgiven? Thus this bleſſed man <hi>David,</hi> is breathing forth, <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe iniquities are forgiven,</hi> Oh bleſs the Lord, Oh my ſoul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities; <hi>Oh how great is thy mercy towards me, and thou haſt delivered my ſoul from the loweſt hell:</hi> So ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, called, redeemed ſouls ſee themſelves call'd and taken out of hell it ſelf: out of a hell of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, pollutions, wrath, under which they were faſt held by the powers of darkneſs. Say, did ever ſuch a ſoul get to Heaven? ſhall I not be the wonder of Heaven and hell, how I got to Heaven, and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that wrath in which thouſands that were better then I are now plunged? there's no other reaſon but becauſe mercy is <hi>great,</hi> greater then the greatneſs of ſin; with which I ſhall conclude the ſecond Point, namely, When ſinners come on to find pardon, they ſee their ſins <hi>great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>The great reaſon of Gods pardoning a ſinner; and the plea that a poor convinced ſinner hath with God, is, that he will pardon for his own Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thy <hi>Names ſake,</hi> Oh Lord, pardon <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, not for any worth that is in a poor creature, not for <hi>my</hi> ſake, but for thy <hi>own</hi> glories ſake, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake; grace and mercy will be hereby glorified. God gets himſelf a Name by the pardoning of a poor ſinner, that <hi>Name</hi> which he proclaims to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.6. — The Lord merciful, and gracious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, God hath given forth the ground of this plea in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> where his Name is thus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170425:28"/>
made moſt glorious. And when He had given forth a brief and bleſſed draught of the tenour of the <hi>New Covenant, Ezek.</hi> 36.21. &amp;c. The Lord gives out this as the great reaſon, often mentioned, why he would take ſuch a way of making another Covenant, where in he <hi>wills</hi> all, <hi>undertakes</hi> all, <hi>does</hi> all, <hi>works</hi> all, as reſolved it ſhould be a Covenant, and a way of grace that ſhould ſurely hold: he gives out this, I ſay, as the ground of all, <hi>I had pity for mine own holy Name,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I do not this for your ſakes, but for mine holy Names ſake,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>I will ſanctifie my great Name,</hi> ver. 23. And when the Lord had ſhewed what he would do for the poor Jewes in ſpecial, and ſo for all ſinners taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, that he would <hi>ſprinkle clean water upon them, cleanſe them from their ſins give them a new heart, put his Spirit upon them, write his Laws in their hearts,</hi> and ſo take them to be <hi>his people,</hi> he again concludes with the ſame ground as before, that all this was ſtill for his own <hi>Name,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I do this, be it known unto you, &amp;c.</hi> And yet, that he would as certainly and fully do it, as if all the engagements from man in the world had been upon him, as <hi>undoubtedly</hi> make good every part and article of the Covenant, he adds, ver. 36. <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I will do it;</hi> you may ſafely abide by it; Neither ſhould his grace and power come hardly from him (as poor doubting ſouls ſurmiſe) as if 'twere as much as ever the Lord could do, to give out mercy and grace to poor ſinners; but, ſaith the bleſſed God, in another place upon the ſame account, having given out the promiſes of grace in the New Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.37. and ſo on, He ſubjoyns,—
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170425:29"/>
                  <hi>I will do it with my whole heart, and my whole ſoul;</hi> mark it, poor ſouls, <hi>with my whole ſoul,</hi> will I pardon you, love you, never turn away from you to do you good, and never ſuffer you to turn away from me. If poor weak ſouls (for whoſe ſake I put it) ſhould here ask, What is this Covenant, what do you mean by it? I have at large opened this to you; only, a word here. God at firſt; when he made man, agreed with man to be his God, to give him life for ever; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe tearms, that man would keep the Law that God gave him, which God alſo writ in his heart, and 'twas a Law that would have given all glory to the Creator, preſerved the creature in a holy and bleſſed order, and been a bleſſing to the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but man tranſgreſſing here, the bleſſed God, from his own good pleaſure, <hi>for his Names ſake,</hi> gives out another Agreement, or Covenant, provides in it tearms of reconciliation, for the firſt breach of the firſt Covenant, ſends his eternal bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt, to be a Mediatour of this new agreement, gives him Commiſſion to <hi>offer</hi> it to all, and that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and to let the World know, that if any ſinner in the world, never ſo great, come and put up his plea, make his claim, enter his claim, accept of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and new agreement with God, accept of the tearms of it, give up himſelf mutually to God back again; then will God be his God, and that upon better tearms then before with <hi>Adam,</hi> pardon, own, love, bleſſe, unite to himſelf, never ſuffer him to fall, mercy built upon an unmoveable foundation, <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>This briefly is the meaning of the New Covenant, upon which all our mercy is built; now from firſt to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170425:29"/>
laſt, from the firſt to the top ſtone of it, from Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Glory, all is done and made good for the Lords own glorious Names ſake. Souls elected, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant tranſacted between God and Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt ſent, the ſinner called, forgiven, juſtified, ſanctified, adopted, kept, glorified, All for his Names ſake; See the promiſes running thus, in moſt places, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions.</hi> Why? <hi>for my own ſake; Purge away our ſins for thy Names ſake.</hi> Pſa. 79.9. This is the bottome of all.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe the further clearing of this bleſſed truth is my deſign, through grace, in the next diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; I ſhall ſpeak but a word more by way of uſe only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If it be thus, that what ever God gives out to poor ſouls, is for his <hi>own Names ſake,</hi> that this is the plea a poor ſinner hath; let it then be for your information and inſtruction, that you have no other plea to be heard in Heaven but this, (the plea of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt being upon the ſame bottom) Dont make a ſorry pile of carnal duties and works, and ſay for the ſake of theſe, Lord do me good, and pardon where I have failed; the Lord may ſend fire from Heaven to conſume thee and them, becauſe of their polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that 'tis a curſed offering, but never hear thee, and bleſſe thee upon ſuch a plea; No, no, ſay in thy ſoul, and that from full conviction, If ever I have any thing from God on this ſide hell, it muſt be for his own Names ſake; I expect, I plead, I wait, upon no other ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. If the Lord's Names ſake be the only plea for grace, then let poor ſinners drawing near to God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170425:30"/>
by Jeſus Chriſt be perſwaded that 'tis a <hi>good</hi> plea, and moſt acceptable before the Lord. Now this is the way of the heart of poor creatures, from rooted ſelf-love &amp; pride; we think, if God could give out good unto us for our ſakes it were ſomething; if there were any thing to be beheld in us that were commendable to the Lord, I could go with ſome confidence; but ſeeing 'tis thus, that I am nothing elſe but vile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, how can I go to him? with what face? or, how can he give out unto me? Sinner; be as low as thou wilt or canſt; but reaſon not ſo with thy ſelf. If God can as freely, as fully do thee good, all good, for his own Names ſake, and hath thereby the more glory by it; Why ſhouldſt thou ſo ſtand upon thy tearms with God, and not be as willing, as conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to accept of mercy, all mercy, for Gods own Names ſake, as well as for <hi>thy</hi> ſake? 'Tis thy pride, be it known unto thee ſinner, as humble as thou thinkeſt thou art, and not thy lowlineſs; know, for thy comfort, God can more readily, eaſily, do thy ſoul good, upon the tearms he now is, for his own ſake; and ſo the thing be done, thy ſoul pardoned, bleſſed, ſaved, and all ſhall end in everlaſting love upon thee, let the Lord have all the glory, though thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt of for thy own ſake. And yet alſo know, that when the Lord ſaith, he doth it for his own ſake, he doth not exclude that he hath <hi>no</hi> reſpect and love unto thee; but that the great and higheſt motive with God was, and is, his own Name, his own glorious grace, why he ever had a thought of good to an undone creature; that there was no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the creature, unleſs miſery, which is no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but all is done, given, eſtated upon ſouls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, poor ſinners freely, for his own ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170425:30"/>3. Let it exhort ſouls to make uſe of this plea, therefore, and that with great, though humble <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> It never failed poor ſouls ſince the world was, that made uſe of it: when they were low and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and eyed and pleaded mercy for mercies ſake, they had it, and never went away but bleſſed.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170425:32"/>
God. So it hath pleaſed the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to order the way of his glorious mercy to poor ſinners that ſhall be ſaved, that he doth not only let forth free grace for the remiſſion of their ſins, &amp; merely pardon them, but hath ſo bleſſedly ordered the matter, to bring them in a ſtate of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> a compleat &amp; perfect righteouſneſs as <hi>Adam</hi> in his perfect eſtate was in, not by making the ſinner perfectly holy &amp; righteous in himſelf, in his own nature; but by giving out his eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt, to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their ſtead, by ſatisfying &amp; keeping the perfect Law of righteouſneſs, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is imputed to the Believer, as if he had fulfilled it, &amp; were wholly righteous in his own perſon; In which lies the great myſtery of the Goſpel. I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>therein is the righteouſneſs of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from faith to faith, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 1.16. namely, that righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt whereby God will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, put in a ſtate of righteouſneſs, made over to them by faith that ſhall be pardoned and ſaved.</p>
               <p>To endeavour to evince and diſcover the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſuch a <hi>juſtification,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of it, and how a poor ſoul comes to be <hi>inveſted</hi> in it, to have a <hi>right</hi> unto it, is my deſign, as the Lord ſhall graciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in this enſuing diſcourſe. Oh that I might do it in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, plainly, convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritually, as I ought to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>In the proſecuting hereof, I ſhall firſt ſhew that righteouſneſs is not to be attained any other way, not by the exacteſt keeping of the Law, ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God; not by ſetting our ſelves to keep the Law of God as well as we can, and ſo we hope God will accept of it; which being naturally
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170425:32"/>
rooted in the hearts of all, I find it the hardeſt piece of conviction, and moſt hardly received of any other; ſouls are a thouſand times more eaſily beaten off groſſe ſins, then beaten off the confidence of the good they think they do, and ſo come as ☞ <hi>Nothing elſe</hi> but ſinners to Jeſus Chriſt; want of this conviction makes all the Hypocrites in the world. This is that part therefore I ſhall firſt begin with, according to the Apoſtles method in this Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle layes down his doctrine, which he was to prove in the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 1 <hi>Chapter, The just ſhall live by faith;</hi> to make way for which, he firſt proves in the remaining part of the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> that the Gentiles knowledge of God, which they had by <hi>the things that are made,</hi> The Creation of, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God over the world, left them in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe becauſe they <hi>held the truth,</hi> of the being of a God, <hi>in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> even the wiſeſt and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt of them, ſuch as <hi>profeſſed themſelves to be wiſe,</hi> verſe 22. and brake forth into Idolatry and all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, <hi>for which cauſe God gave them up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 26.28. At the 17th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 2d. <hi>Chap.</hi> The Apoſtle undertakes the Jew, ſtrikes off all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and at the 9th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 3d. <hi>Chapter,</hi> concludes both Jew and Gentile, in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as to the obteyning of ſuch a righteouſneſſe by the Law, that might commend either to God;— <hi>What then? Are we</hi> (who are Jews) <hi>better then they?</hi> (who are Gentiles). <hi>No, in no wiſe, for we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Jews and Gentiles are all under ſin, As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one;</hi> Which he further proves by ſeverall Scriptures to the words of the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170425:33"/>In which the Apoſtle prevents an objection, namely, that ſome might urge, The Scriptures ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged may concerne ſome few and groſly wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not all mankind in generall; No ſuch matter; <hi>whatever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law,</hi> which are, all the Sons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in their naturall corrupt eſtate, All under the law, from whence the Apoſtle inſerrs, (1.) That therefore <hi>every mouth is ſtopped,</hi> (2.) All the world is guilty before God. (3.) That no fleſh, within or without the Church, can be juſtified by the Law. From whence I draw theſe 4 plain obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to prove what is my main deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man can attain to ſuch a meaſure of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by all that ever he can do, in his beſt keeping the Law, as may commend him to God; which 4 are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Every ſon and daughter of</hi> Adam <hi>in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate are under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That a tranſgreſſour of the Law, hath nothing to boaſt in, nor to excuſe himſelf from his ſin, or the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment of God due unto him.</hi> [That every mouth may be ſtopped.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Every ſoul in the world is under guilt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> [that all the world may be guilty before God.]</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Every ſoul lies under an impoſſibility of reaching to ſuch a Juſtification, by the best keeping of the Law, as for God thereby to accept of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intend briefneſſe in the opening of theſe, and what <hi>plaineſſe</hi> alſo the Lord ſhall help me with; This is a principle <hi>rooted</hi> in the hearts of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: That ſtill there is a ſufficiency in them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170425:33"/>
to keep the law of God in ſuch a meaſure as God will accept them for it; This being heightned, by the ignorance of times, and darkneſſe of Goſpell-light, and of the New-Covenant of grace, upon the ſpirits of this Generation, they are moſt hardly beaten off it; ſay poor ſouls, If I keep Gods law as well as I can, and worſhip God, and do not harme my Neighbour, God will accept me, and pardon where I fail; but to be convinced that all that keeping of the law is made void by one ſin, and ſo ſee an abſolute neceſſity of righteouſneſſe, another way and out of themſelves by Ieſus Chriſt, though it be preacht by many good men, yet few, very few, in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration live in the practicall ſenſe and ſight of it; yea how many profeſſours (not hereby to reproach any) have confeſſed to the Glory of God, and their own abaſement, that ſince the breaking forth of a fuller light of the nature of the New-Covenant, Goſpel-grace, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, they have bin ſhaken in their bottomes, being legall, and thought if they took up from their ſins, and had a kind of ſorrow for them, and then ſet themſelves to obey the law ſtrictly, be cloſe in the ſabbath, and ſome ſuch duties, that God would accept them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill ignorant, as leaſt practically, that when they were convinced of ſin, they were to ſee where to have a righteouſneſſe, and how to get into Chriſt, and have life and ſtrength in and from him for their new obedience; which is that I drive at in this, and my afterwards diſcourſe in opening the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>in</hi> Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed this I come to ſpeak to the firſt promiſe laid down, namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:170425:34"/>Obſerv. 1. <hi>Every ſon and daughter of</hi> Adam <hi>in their naturall eſtate are under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Law, I do not mean the Moſaicall or old Teſtament way of worſhip; but by the law, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which we ſtyle the morall law, the law of the 10 Commandements, that was written in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> heart, and afterwards given out by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and promiſed in the New Covenant to be written again in the hearts of all that are really called into the grace of the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27.</p>
               <p>To be <hi>under the Law,</hi> is an expreſſion familiar to you, you know what it is to live under a law: To be under this law of God, then beſpeakes theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be <hi>under it,</hi> is to be bound over to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> fulfilling it: ſee Rom. 10.15. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> that is it, to be bound over to the fulfilling and doing of the law, which if done exactly, without the leaſt devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is life promiſed to it: But upon the leaſt tranſgreſſion of it, to be lyable to the penalty which God hath pronounced againſt the tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It followes thence, that to be <hi>under the Law,</hi> is to be bound over <hi>to the whole Law,</hi> in its full and perfect latitude, as it reacheth the whole man. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law to do them:</hi> Mark well the tenour of theſe words. Here is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Every one</hi> an exact <hi>doing</hi> (not onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and thinking to do); and that not onely
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170425:34"/>
of ſome or the moſt of the law, <hi>but in all things,</hi> and that not onely for a time, but a <hi>Continuance</hi> of doing ſo: or elſe under the curſe: One ſinfull thought hath a curſe belonging to it, as well as the breach of the whole law, if under the law. <hi>Whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the law,</hi> 1 John 3.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be <hi>under the law,</hi> is to be <hi>ſubject to, and to be under,</hi> all the curſes, threatenings, judgments, wrath, that it threatneth to the tranſgreſſours of it, here and for ever: Whatſoever the law ſaith, in point alſo of judgment and wrath, it ſaith to all that are under it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be <hi>under it,</hi> is to be bound to <hi>make God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> in our own perſons for the breach of it, I mean while under it, every ſoul is ſo obliged to make ſatisfaction, to the juſtice of God: If a poor ſoul be in his naturall eſtate, and ſo under the law; he muſt ſtand or fall to the law, God expects perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſatisfaction from every ſoul that ſinneth againſt it, that will ſtand to his keeping the law, in whole or in part, and God in his juſtice can bate nothing of what he hath ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Now, That all men and women are by nature, as of and in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> thus under the law, to wit, to be bound up to it, and to have life onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exact and perfect fulfilling of it, to be bound up to the <hi>whole</hi> law, ſubject to the curſe of it, upon the tranſgreſſion of <hi>one part,</hi> bound to make God <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> in his own perſon for any breach thereof, I briefly prove.</p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace;</hi> Implying, till a ſoul is brought
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170425:35"/>
under grace, the Covenant of grace, juſtifying &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace in and by Jeſus Chriſt, he is <hi>under the</hi> law, whoever he be; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5.— <hi>To redeem them that were under the law,</hi> &amp;c. implying alſo that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are naturally under it, till under the power and efficacy and priviledge of Chriſts Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The main reaſons of it are,</p>
               <p>All are under this law, becauſe all mankind were bound up under the ſame Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> who was a publick perſon repreſenting all mankind, as a man may bind up himſelf and his poſterity to ſuch and ſuch conditions; and, ſuch a Covenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or obligation binds his poſterity in Law: ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> bound up to God; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Scriptures that prove this truth; <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned;</hi> ſo <hi>verſe</hi> 16.17, 18, 19. <hi>by one that ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by one mans offence death reigned by one; by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation: By one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners:</hi> Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly, that the guilt of <hi>Adam,</hi> as repreſenting all his poſterity, was and is imputed to all; <hi>and therefore all were, and are bound over to the ſame Law;</hi> bottomed upon that word of the Lord to <hi>Adam,</hi> by which God put the Covenant upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>For in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye. Adam</hi> had the law of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, the morall law, written in his heart before, and his nature perfect, which bound him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obey every command of his God; now God gave out that external law, unto him by way of tryal,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170425:35"/>
in which the form of the Covenant was implyed; but ſinning againſt that, he tranſgreſſed the morall law, written in his heart alſo, which bound him over to obey God in all things: ſo that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was (at leaſt virtually) a tranſgreſſion of the morall law, now abiding and obliging mankind; which law we all brake in him, as it was given to all in him, and being written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, it was as much as if it had bin actually written in the hearts of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: which doth alſo appear by the remnants of the law, (as that there is a God, and man ſhould be juſt,) yet remaining in the hearts of all: Therefore by nature we are all bound up to, and are under, this law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth appear that <hi>all</hi> do ſin and tranſgreſſe this law of <hi>God,</hi> therefore <hi>they are under</hi> the penalty and condemnation of it: this argument the Apoſtle brings to prove the ſame thing, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. of this 3d. of the <hi>Rom.— For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin:</hi> and verſe 12. <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one;</hi> Threfore ſeeing all do ſin, they are bound to anſwer the law, (as you uſe to phraſe it,) and are ſubject to whatſoever the law pronounceth againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the <hi>partiall</hi> keping of the law, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a ſoul from that penalty that belongs to the breach of the whole: keep me all or none, as to your deliverance from the curſe, ſaith the law. But this I am further to prove, when I ſpeak to the next verſe, The impoſſibility of a ſinners being accepted by his beſt keeping of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:170425:36"/>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Are all men and women in the world, young and old, naturally under the law, <hi>bound over to the moſt exact and rigorous fulfilling of it, under a curſe,</hi> and are indeed under all the curſes and threanings it pronounceth, and bound to make <hi>God</hi> ſatisfaction in your own perſons, while you are under it; oh let every poor ſinner be convinced of it, what a ſtate is this for any poor ſoul to reſt it ſelf ſatisfied in? who is the man or woman that is not a tranſgreſſour of it? and therefore, ſee to it, and that before the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment come upon thee without remedy. Sinner, If thou waſt condemned by the law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſentence of death, how wouldſt thou beg for a reprieve? and beg all thy friends to interpoſe for thee; what an amazing word would it be to thee? <hi>Thou art condemned to dye.</hi> Ah ſinner, tis the caſe of thy precious ſoul, Thou art condemn'd to eternall death, by the law of <hi>God,</hi> the ſentence is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the righteous Judge of Heaven; Away ſinner, with all ſpeed to a <hi>Mercy ſeat,</hi> Acknowledge thy condemnation juſt by the law, Go to the great and potent <hi>Advocate</hi> of heaven, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, put thy caſe into his hand, tell him thou haſt none elſe to make to, and that thou haſt heard, he hath helped many a condemned ſinner, in the ſame caſe as thou art, and that thou haſt heard he hath layd down a price for ſuch as thou art to redeem them from the curſe of the Law: follow him, and if he ſpeak but a word to the juſt and great God for thee, the ſentence of the Law is remitted, a pardon of grace comes forth, and at laſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall be ſent from the father, and the Son to <hi>witneſſe</hi> it, <hi>and ſeal</hi> it in thy own conſcience; and that bleſſed word ſhall be thine, <hi>Therefore there is now, No condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170425:36"/>
&amp;c. who ſhall condemn me, ſince Jeſus Chriſt hath cleared me? and hath made the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for me? Go and ponder in thy ſoul every day; and ſay, Is't nothing to be under a Curſe? condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Law to be damned for ever? ſhall I let my poor ſoul lye in ſuch a caſe one hour longer, ſpecially when a way I hear is opened to me to get from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? Say what ſatifaction can I wretched creature, make to the righteous God? None, but by ſuffering what infinite juſtice will lay upon me, which is no leſſe then infinite puniſhment. Oh get in upon thy conſcience, what it is to be <hi>condemned</hi> by the great <hi>God,</hi> to lye under guilt, to have <hi>no plea</hi> or <hi>excuſe</hi> by the law left thee; which I will labour to prove to thy conſcience, and then further urge thee, which is the import of the next point.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>A tranſgreſſour of the law, as he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt in, ſo he hath nothing to excuſe himſelf for his ſin, or from the righteous judgment of God due unto him;</hi> which is drawn from theſe words.— <hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle intimates, Rom. 2.1. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art inexcuſable, ô man,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaking to the <hi>Jew,</hi> who went about to free himſelf.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. A poor ſinner hath nothing to excuſe himſelf for ſinning againſt the law of God, <hi>becauſe the law is good and righteous,</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>Therefore the law is holy, and the Commandement holy, juſt, and good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was under ſuch a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinning againſt it as we are preſſing; So, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>But we know that the Law is good,</hi> &amp;c. Tis a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170425:37"/>
law that containes glory to the Creatour, and all good and bleſſedneſſe, (as in its ſelf,) to the creature, A law that's full of all wiſdome, and bleſſedneſſe, takes care for the good, bleſſing, peace, order of the whole Creation, that man might not ſin againſt his maker, nor, in the leaſt, harme (nor think to do ſo) his fellow creature, ſo that its proper end is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, preſervation to all; Now what excuſe for a creature, moſt concern'd in the good of it, for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt ſuch a law? what hath a creature to ſay for himſelf? how inexcuſable is he before <hi>God,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and men?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God</hi> writ this holy and bleſſed law in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was a publique perſon, whereby he, and in him all mankind, had <hi>power</hi> to keep it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſinner hath no excuſe before <hi>God;</hi> He gave man a power, though he did not lay a neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his will, but left him to the liberty of it, but man corrupted himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. whereby he diſabled himſelf from keeping the law: Now if a man diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, it can be no rationall excuſe for negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the duty, ſo that his mouth is ſtopped as to any plea or excuſe before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though man had blurred and defaced the fair and originall Copy of this holy and good law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, yet <hi>God</hi> gave it forth again by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in Legible Characters, one end wherefore was to leave all mankind without excuſe; thereof this ſtrikes off all plea for the ſinner, ſpecially to ſuch to whom it is revealed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a remnant of this law yet in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> which though not ſufficient to enable him to an exact performance of it, yet enough to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170425:37"/>
leave him without excuſe; ſo <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.15. to prove this point we are now upon, ſpeaking of the Gentiles. — <hi>Which ſhew the workes of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> There is enough of the law remaining in every mans heart to accuſe him, when he doth evil; and excuſe him ſo far as he doth right, though man by habituall ſinning, doth much ſtifle it; ſo that this alſo helps to aggravate his ſin, and to leave him without all plea or excuſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is that to be known of <hi>God,</hi> in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that may and doth leave a ſinner without all excuſe for ſinning againſt him; this the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues as to this very purpoſe; Rom. 1.20. <hi>For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and god-head, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> &amp;c. The creatures could not ſay, we will make our ſelves thus and thus, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch an order and harmony; therefore there was one firſt Infinite being who made all things, and by the ſame power doth uphold them, to which <hi>firſt Being,</hi> all the creatures muſt owe their homage and conformity; Now though ſuch a glimmering of light can never ſuffice to lead a ſoul to the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, as the Apoſtle there argues; yet it leaves the creature without excuſe, which is that I am proving from it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All the Children of men do ſin <hi>preſumtuouſly, willfully,</hi> and <hi>obſtinately</hi> againſt the Law of God: mans ſin being not ſo much from his weakneſſe to obey the law, (though weak he is) but from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170425:38"/>
of his will againſt God and his law; As it is in the caſe of diſobeying the call of the Goſpel alſo; Now whatſoever a man doth preſumptuouſly &amp; willfully, it leaves him without all excuſe; And this is it that is charged upon the Children of men, by the holy Ghoſt in the word, that their ſin was obſtinate rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great God;</p>
               <p>From all theſe the truth of the aſſertion doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that every tranſgreſſour of the law is without all excuſe before God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As the creature hath no excuſe for his ſin, ſo it followes he hath no pretence againſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of God; <hi>we are ſure the judgment of God is according to truth,</hi> Rom. 2.2. and Chap. 3.4. That thou mayſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and clear when thou art judged; that is, what ever any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may diſpute to the contrary, God is righteous when he judgeth; If the Law be juſt and holy and good, once written in his heart, and had a power to have kept it, that God hath given out this law again to him, the remnants of it in his heart, ſo much to be known of God in the creatures, and that he ſins preſumptuouſly and wilfully againſt God, and ſo bleſſed a law, made for his own good, certainly muſt every ſinner conclude, The Lord is righteous when he judgeth, and every mouth muſt be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If it be ſo that no ſinner in the world hath any juſtifiable excuſe for his ſin, then let this truth come in into your conſciences, and ſtrike off all vain pretences, and wretched excuſes when you have ſinned againſt the Lord; which uſually are ſuch as theſe; when ſinners break forth into this or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170425:38"/>
way, they cry, Oh tis my nature, my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition; and then they think, that excuſeth or allayeth the matter, whereas it aggravates, for we ourſelves corrupted our natures. Saith another, I have bin ſo accuſtomed to ſuch a way, to drink to exceſſe, ſometimes to ſwear, to uſe the Lords name vainly, and as a by-word; whereas the cuſtome of ſinning is the greateſt and moſt grievious aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Saith another, 'tis my company that drawes me or the example of others, or 'tis my temptation, when they are under the Spirit that worketh in the Children of diſobedience; Or, that they do keep the law as well as they can, and think this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: whereas nothing, no plea that ever a ſinfull deceitfull heart put up, or that the Devil ſuggeſts, can before God excuſe any ſinner in the world, rich or poor, knowing or ignorant, from the exact and perfect keeping of the law, (if they are yet under the law) but upon one tranſgreſſion of it, the law doth moſt juſtly condemn and curſe them;</p>
               <p>Nothing is more naturall to fallen man, under ſin, then when having ſinned to deviſe an excuſe, and thinks and ſurmiſeth, that becauſe ſuch an excuſe will be taken by his own blinded conſcience, therefore God will alſo accept of it, &amp; ſo, <hi>flatters himſelf in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found to be hatefull,</hi> Pſal. 36.2. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> as aſſoon as he had ſin'd, he thought how to excuſe the matter, puts it off to the woman, and the woman to the devil, which trade ſinners have well learnt, and have driven it on ever ſince to their own damnation; Obſerve this, If every ſinner, yet under the law, and the power of ſinne, had not ſome vain pretence and excuſe to enſilence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170425:39"/>
conſcience, and fooliſhly thinks to inſinuate unto God, he, or ſhe, muſt needs fall down before the Lord, ſee all their pretences and coverts to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable flatteryes, and ſoul-cheatings, and ſo <hi>Judge</hi> themſelves, and pronounce God moſt righteous, if he damn them for ever;</p>
               <p>Oh therefore, ſinners, Away with all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, no more excuſing, but judging, and go to the great God, and fall down at his feet, crying out, oh I am a tranſgreſſour, the law condemns me, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe will be taken, my mouth is now ſtopped; what ever God do with me, he is moſt holy and righteous. If I were going to Hell I muſt juſtifie God; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay unto him, why doeſt thou thus? Thus tis with a poor ſoul, when the Lord by his word and ſpirit opens ſin, reveales the law, layes it in upon the conſcience, diſcovers the holineſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe of his juſtice, that the law ſhewes no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but cryes out for fulfilling, or pronounceth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute condemnation, then I ſay, a ſinner cryes out, Oh I am caſt by the Law, I am gone by the Law, All my pleas are found too light, All my endeavour to keep it, is worth nothing, if guilty in the leaſt, while I am under the law. I muſt find out a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe elſe where, another way, or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, juſt condemnation is my portion for ever; Here's the firſt ſtroke of a convinced ſinner, when <hi>God</hi> is outing him from himſelf, and all his coverts or excuſes, and brings him naked to put on the righteouſneſſe of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, freely held out in the goſpel; which is the work in hand.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:170425:39"/>2. If no excuſe can be heard or taken, for the tranſgreſſion of the law, for but one breach of it, but every mouth is ſtopped; how much leſſe will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuſe be taken, for withſtanding the goſpell of grace by Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith our bleſſed Lord. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin,</hi> (that is, not ſo great ſinne and condemnation) <hi>but now they have no cloak,</hi> (nor excuſe) <hi>for their ſinne;</hi> If a righteous law, leave all the world without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, much more a goſpel that offers free grace, and pardon, and righteouſneſſe, by Jeſus Chriſt to any ſinner, condemn'd by the law, that will come in, as ſo condemn'd, and accept of the free gift of righteouſneſſe by him.</p>
               <p>But that I may yet a little further labour to bring in the ſenſe of guilt upon the ſoul, I ſhall prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul, <hi>guilty before God</hi> of the tranſgreſſion of the law, and ſhew what the ſenſe of guilt is, which few there are that have, in a ſaving way.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>Every ſoul in the world is guilty before God of the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> — And all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
               <p>This hath been proved where we have ſhew'd that <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>guilt</hi> is threefold, which is ſet home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſinners heart, when convinc'd of ſin by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin which ſtands charg'd upon every ſinner in the world, while under the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The guilt of the <hi>corruption of our natures,</hi> ſinne in the fountain as I have ſhewed, which is likewiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170425:40"/>
upon every Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam, they are all corrupt,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. wherein lies the exceeding ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The guilt of <hi>actuall rebellion</hi> againſt God, ſinne brought forth, and acted in the outward man againſt God.</p>
               <p>Now under this threefold guilt is every ſinner in the world, while under the law, the effect of which, if not reconciled, is puniſhment ſutable to the guilt; which is,— Thou ſhall ſurely dye, And, <hi>The wages of ſinne is death,</hi> eternall death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This may therefore <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>convince</hi> that every ſin brings <hi>guilt</hi> upon the ſoul, and ſo deſerves death and everlaſting wrath from God; you that make light of ſin, to lye, to profane the name of the Lord, be in worldly diſcourſes on the Lords day, in any way of ſin whatſoever, weigh this in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, There's not the leaſt ſin but makes thee <hi>guilty</hi> before the tribunall of God; God, the law, Angels, Conſcience, are all witneſſes againſt thee; where's the ſoul that will think to avoid this charge? ſhall I prove every ſoul of you guilty, and that before God? If this were proved by the power of the word in the conſcience, I know what, (and I ſhall ſhew it you), will be the effect of it; lay your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the Word, and if thou art found <hi>guilty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord this day, go home with the ſenſe of it upon thy ſoul, and do as a <hi>guilty</hi> ſinner ſhould do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider firſt, as to what concerns God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; The Law requires; Thou ſhouldſt have no other Gods but him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Which Jeſus
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170425:40"/>
Chriſt interprets, is, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul; now, Hath God had thy whole heart and ſoul, dareſt thou ſay ſo? Hath not the world had more of thy heart then God? Doſt not thou love the world, and the things of it? Do not thy affections, thoughts, deſires of thy heart even day and night go after it? yea, you cannot but grant, that 'tis ſo? Then God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are witneſſe, that thou art guilty of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin of Idolatry. And ſuch a one, ſhall not, as ſuch, enter into the kingdome of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. Know by that Scripture, A covetous heart may ſend thee to Hell, as well as any ſin in the world; — <hi>No Covetous man, who is an Idolater, ſhall enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> read over the place every day, and tremble at it; Here's guilt already enough to damn thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou haſt worſhipped God ſuperſtitiouſly and idolatrouſly, after the traditions and commandments of men: you that are elderly people are all guilty here, in a grievous manner in the time of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when ſuperſtitious Ceremonies were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Common-prayer-Book worſhip was upheld, when you polluted the Ordinances of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, coming to Sacraments with ſins upon your ſouls, from which ſins you are not converted and changed to this day, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>eating and drinking damnation,</hi> or judgment; under which guilt you ſtill lye, and would heap up more of this guilt, were not ſome more tender of your ſouls then your ſelves? Here's guilt to purpoſe, who is free from it? and how many unhumbled under it to this day? Art thou not now ready to cry
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170425:41"/>
out, Oh hold, hold, you need go no further, my conſcience is ſmitten, oh, guilt, great guilt lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? Oh that 'twere the cry of many ſouls before the Lord, how might it end in mercy that ſhall be for ever!</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet further to purſue thy conſcience, (for that's the nature of guilt) doth not the Lord require in his law, that thou <hi>ſhouldſt not take his Name in vain, Exod.</hi> 20.7. Now ſinner, ſtave off this guilt, if thou canſt; How oft haſt thou abuſed and profaned this great and dreadfull Name, the Lord thy God; by ſwearing, or, in thy by-words, crying, <hi>oh Lord, oh God, for Gods ſake, for Chriſts ſake,</hi> upon every fooliſh vain occaſion, with no more reverence of his Name, then the moſt Common name in the world; And ſome of you have as many dayes as you have lived ſince your childhood bin frequently guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this great evil; which thou haſt made a ſmall matter of, which if ever God pardon it, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be odious guilt, from the height of thy heart-Atheiſm. How oft haſt thou heard the word, and thy heart bin after the world, and thine eyes gazing up and down, that tis eaſie to diſcern thou regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not what is ſpoken from God to thee; and the ſame in prayer, how oft haſt thou babled ore the Lords prayer like a charme, with no reverence of Gods Majeſty upon thy ſoul; in thy bed, it may be, in a drowſie manner, or if otherwiſe not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the words thou ſpeakeſt, much leſſe thy heart affected with them, or it may be ſaying over the Creed, and the Commandements, or ſome Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book prayers, as abundance do, grievouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning Gods Name, and offering lip labour, which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170425:41"/>
his ſoul abhorreth; yea know what hath bin often proved, that thy prayers, and all thy worſhip, and good deeds, (as thou calleſt them) are an <hi>abomination</hi> to the Lord, while thou art in thy ſin, an unconverted and unholy perſon; yea the way of thy worſhip, in which thou placeſt thy greateſt confidence, hath bin the higheſt aggravation of thy ſin, in offering up to God that which his ſoul hateth; <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. —<hi>When you make many prayers</hi> (ſaith the Lord) I will not hear you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the ſanctifying the Sabbath, which thou ſhouldeſt make a <hi>holy</hi> reſt unto God, thou haſt made it a meer <hi>fleſhly</hi> reſt, conſuming the day upon thy luſts, in vanity, idleneſſe, carnall and worldly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in families, in the ſtreets, to the high diſhonour of the Name of God, and hardening of thy heart againſt the truths of God, rendring thereby the preaching of the Goſpel, wholly unprofitable to thy ſoul; A carriage farr unlike a man that hath the grace of God upon him, and a moſt invincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thy conſcience, that thou makeſt not God, his word, ordinances, ſabbaths, a holy delight, and knoweſt not the excellency and ſweetneſſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; Say, ſinner, and lay thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this conviction, is hearing and that with love, praying, praiſing, meditating, conferring of holy things, the very heaven of thy ſoul, and ſo longeſt for ſuch exerciſes, as the joy and ſtrength of thy heart? Nothing leſſe! Thy own conſcience being Judge; but hear drowſily and negligently, it may be deſpiſingly; revile the preacher, ſpeak evil of the word, out of thy groſſe ignorance, and hatred to be reformed, ſpeak vainly, carnally, worldly, with ſuch
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170425:42"/>
as are like thy ſelf. Here's guilt enough to ſend thee to a thouſand Hells, if <hi>God</hi> ſmite not thy heart for it, and thou turn not unto him for pardon and a better heart to be given to thee.</p>
               <p>Adde to all this, an unthankfull and unholy uſe of <hi>Gods</hi> good Creatures; it may be thou haſt bin betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the devil, &amp; thy own ready heart to ſome ſecret ſins, which thou thinkeſt enough if thou canſt hide from man, not conſidering the judgment of <hi>God</hi> that hangs over thee. But if not ſo, yet a heart full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, envy, wrath, malice; which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his opening the law in its ſpirituality, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21.22, 27, 28. convinceth to be murder and adultery, which, it may be, thou haſt never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, ſo thou haſt not bin an actuall adulterer, or murderer; In a word, There's not a vain thought in thy heart, the firſt riſing of it, but brings thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of condemnation of the law, and as thou art under the law, as if a tranſgreſſour in thought, word, and deed, of the whole Law; This may ſeem ſtrange to thee, but ſee it proved. <hi>James</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point is guilty of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it hath bin proved that thou art <hi>guilty,</hi> of the breach of every Commandement of God, from thy youth up;</p>
               <p>But ſee further, ſinner, (that ſome word of God or other may hit thee) this law could not condemn thee, wouldſt thou have bin convinced of guilt, and made in to grace by Jeſus Chriſt, but thou art under the <hi>guilt</hi> of Goſpel Contempt; Come ſinner, ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, and ſee what I can and will do for thee, Ile ſave thee from this condemning Law, Ile take
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170425:42"/>
away the curſe, Ile remove all thy guilt, blot out all the charge, that is againſt thee, Ile put a righteouſneſſe upon thee, Ile beſtow my ſpirit upon thee, Ile give thee a heart to love God and his law, and in the inward man to delight to walk in it, and then take thee to Heaven, and fill thee with glory for ever. All this Heaven of mercy and free grace, thou haſt ſleighted, and ſinned againſt, and brought thy ſelf under greater condemnation, than by the law; And yet, by the way, Jeſus Chriſt will do as much for thee ſtill as I have ſpoken of and more: though thou haſt thus ſinned againſt law and goſpel, if thou wilt come a poor undone guilty ſoul unto him, which is that I aime at in thus preſſing upon thee; And were the ſenſe of guilt indeed upon thy ſoul, thou wouldſt ſeriouſly hearken to me.</p>
               <p>Therefore yet futher bear with me, Take home this guilt to thy conſcience, And ſay, Oh <hi>guilty, guilty,</hi> of all that hath bin this day charged from the righteous God upon me; Oh may the Lord find thee out this day, and lay-in the freſh ſenſe of the guilt of ſins, even of ſuch thou haſt long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; Do not <hi>juſtifie</hi> nor <hi>excuſe</hi> thy ſelf any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for that's the naturall way of thy heart, as thou haſt bin ſhewed. Never did guilty priſoner at the barre find more ſhifts, more ſubtle pleas, then the proud and ſhameleſſe heart of a ſinner will do, till God himſelf pronounce guilt in the conſcience, and then the guilt of one ſin laid-in, brings in the guilt of all other, and they ſometimes come in like waves and billowes upon thy ſoul; oh let the ſenſe of thy lying, ſwearing, profaning the Sabbath, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, refuſing Jeſus Chriſt out of thy ſecret
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170425:43"/>
hatred of holineſſe, reproaching the people of God, becauſe in their practiſe they condemne thee, or thy being guilty of the blood of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. (a crying ſin indeed,) Oh let this, any, all, ſeize upon thee, and fly not from it, but go and lye low before the great God in it, judging, charging, condemning thy ſelf, and ſay; God and his word hath found me out this day, and I go home with an arrow of God in my conſcience, I am the man or woman, that am found the guiltyeſt ſoul in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how to be delivered and ſaved from it, that's my buſineſſe now. Bleſſed be the advice and counſell now, (which formerly I deſpiſed) of any good man that ſpeakes in the name of the Lord unto me, and will ſhew me, There is yet hope for ſo wretched a Creature as I am;</p>
               <p>Particularly, theſe are the effects of the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, wrought by the holy Ghoſt upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a poor ſoul, in order to his ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Fear of wrath to come, more or leſſe, poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart; Can a man be guilty and not fear, if truly ſenſible of it? This was upon <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had ſinned, and heard Gods voice, which ſtruck him with ſenſe of guilt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I heard thy voice and was afraid;</hi> ſo when guilt came upon <hi>Belſhazzar, his thoughts troubled him,</hi> Dan. 5.6. <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. The <hi>Jaylour</hi> came <hi>trembling,</hi> Acts 16.29. The fear of wrath, the fear of a miſ-carrying ſoul, the fear of eternity, ſeizeth upon the ſpirit of a poor creature; and then tis an infinite weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a poor ſoul to be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Shame</hi> is another effect of <hi>guilt</hi> brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> likewiſe was aſhamed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170425:43"/>
and <hi>hid himſelf,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>naked, Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>What fruit had you in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed;</hi> Rom. 6.21. <hi>So</hi> Ezek. 16. <hi>laſt. That thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſayth the Lord;</hi> See alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11. Oh how is a ſenſibly guilty ſoul aſhamed before God, Angels, &amp; men, of ſuch wayes and carriages, in which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently before delighted himſelf? and lyes down in his ſhame and confuſion of face, even covering his face before God, and aſhamed to look up unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoul walkes up and down with <hi>a burthened</hi> ſpirit, thoſe creature-comforts, delights, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which before would ſtill the ſpirit, now will not; ſenſe of guilt eates out the heart of them, the ſoul muſt now have ſomething elſe than wind and vanity, (for ſo are Creatures become to ſuch a poor ſoul): It may be the deceitfull heart carryes a poor creature to this thing and that, but finds no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction there, the burthen ſtills remaines, the arrow that God hath ſhot ſticks faſt, till Jeſus Chriſt pluck it forth, and heales all with his blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Guilty ſouls, make out for deliverance, ſue to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are enquiring how the law may be ſatisfied, how guilt may be removed, how atonement may be had, how bondage taken off; in a word how he may come to ſee the face of a bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> reconciled in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo love him and bleſſe him to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170425:44"/>Why now, careleſſe ſinner, Is't not better be thus then be hardening for Hell? and have the guilt of ſinne as nothing to thee, till the books ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all thy ſins written in Letters of blood againſt thee, Conſcience accuſed, charged, and witneſſing againſt thee, and ſo away ſcreeking to Hell without all remedy, and canſt not be heard a word for thy ſelf, nor any one, Saint, or Angel for thee; Now thou mayeſt be heard, if thou wilt ſpeedily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy guilt, not <hi>cover thy tranſgreſſion,</hi> nor <hi>hide thy iniquity in thy boſome,</hi> Job 31.33. but come with fear, and ſhame, burthen'd with thy guilt, to him whoſe armes are yet open to receive thee, and is ready to take away thy iniquity off thee, and take off thy burthens, put his hand under thy ſoul: and if thou wouldſt know who it is, tis that bleſſed Jeſus who loves to ſave ſuch a ſinner as he loves his life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore away to him.</p>
               <p>But the heart of a guilty ſinner will now urge, Well if it be ſo, that ſome guilt is upon me, yet I have done many things well, or as well as I could, will not that take off my guilt, and will not <hi>God</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the good to me, and paſſe by the evil? Or will not <hi>God</hi> accept of the will for the deed? Or if I ſet my ſelf for the time to come, to keep the law as well as I can, will not that make <hi>God</hi> amends? Alas poor ſoul, theſe refuges will undo thee, if thou get not out of them, No, No; Thy good ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, nor thy will accepted, nor thy obedience for time to come ſatisfie; I mean, ſtill as thou art under the law. <hi>As well as thou canst,</hi> will not he heard here; If thou indeed gets juſtified in Chriſt, and rooted in him, and ſo from a new principle of life in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170425:44"/>
thy ſoul, thou bring forth new and holy obedience, then thy will is accepted, and thy new obedience, but not upon this account, as to juſtifie thee before <hi>God;</hi> or as to expiate and take off guilt from the ſoul.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the next thing I am to prove to thy Conſcience, if <hi>God</hi> will, Namely,</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>No man or woman under heaven, can ever arrive at ſuch a keeping of the law, as to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, for and by ſuch a keeping of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would preſſe this as plainly as I may, for till this conviction be thoroughly and practically recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the conſcience, a ſoul cannot make a ſaving cloze with Jeſus Chriſt;</p>
               <p>What I mean by theſe deeds of the Law, is, I preſume, underſtood; I mean, The profeſſed owning the true God, and frequenting his ordained worſhip, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, obſerving the Sabbath, making good pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, doing ſome good, as to helping thy neighbour and giving of Almes, making conſcience of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or defrauding any man, and refrayning many groſſe ſins; I mention theſe things, becauſe moſt men that go thus farre, as your more civill ſort of people, think that is it impoſſible, but God muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them in and for all this; that 'tis for great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be damned, they thank God they are not ſo; By the way, ſoul, I ſhall not doubt to prove, that there's more hope of the vileſt drunkard in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then of ſuch a one; and that this thy good keeping of the law, and that as well as thou canſt, will ſtand thee in no ſteed, at all; and God looks upon thee no more for it, then if thou wert the greateſt ſinner in the world; How ſayſt thou, ſoul, to this?</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170425:45"/>1. From clear Scriptures I ſhall demonſtrate it, and Scripturall reaſons, and examples of ſuch kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rejected of God, and ſo labour to drive this nail home upon thy conſcience.</p>
               <p>What need we go further then the words of my Text; <hi>By the deeds of the law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to own and make Conſcience of keeping the law, as well as they could, ſuch as were within (as you call it) the pale of the Church, and frequented the worſhip of God, and were ſober people: ſee Act. 13.39.— <hi>From which</hi> (meaning their ſins) <hi>they could not be juſtified by the law of</hi> Moſes; They <hi>could</hi> not! an utter impoſſibility of it, though they kept the law of God, as well as they were able, and hoped for pardon thereby, yet ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled them) they could not be <hi>juſtified</hi> thereby; Rom. 9.31. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the law of righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſſe;</hi> Though they followed after it, and laboured to keep the Law of God to their utmoſt, yet they faild of their purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe;</hi> that is, ſuch as inſiſt upon works of the law, they are ſo far from being the more accepted for all the good they did, &amp; all the evil they refrained, that they were under the curſe, as well as any ſinners in the world beſides.</p>
               <p>Briefly, <hi>Paul,</hi> who well knew the experience of this, it having bin his own caſe, as I ſhall ſhew, ſpends two Epiſtles, of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galathians</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince chiefly what I am now upon; therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them over and over.</p>
               <p>Now the Reaſons of it are theſe, namely, why
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170425:45"/>
any ſinner's keeping of the Law to his beſt power, cannot juſtifie him, or make him the better, or at all accepted with God for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This doctrine goes to the quick, and I know naturally you do not love it, and 'tis irkſome, and diſquieting; the Lord make it diſquieting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling to purpoſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The beſt keeping of the law cannot make a ſoul more accepted with God, (while under the law, &amp; not in Chriſt) <hi>becauſe of the holineſs of Gods Juſtice,</hi> which being violated by ſin, (it being alſo proved that <hi>All</hi> do ſin) cannot again be made up by any act of the Creature, the ſeverity of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice cannot admit of it, therefore if the Law be tranſgreſſed, the ſinner muſt dye, as he is under the law, and ſtands to the law, or God is not righteous, which to aſſert were exercrable blaſphemy. And if your thoughts ſhould prevent me, with a generall notion of mercy, know, and conſider it well, that the law ſhewes no mercy, but calls for juſtice, and juſtice it ſhall have upon every trangreſſour whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if he <hi>ſtand</hi> to his endeavour to keep the Law; <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye.</hi> From whence, by the law, I ſay, by the law, there's no appeal: what you may do when you renounce the Law, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fly wholly to a mercy-ſeat is another caſe. This the firſt reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The beſt keeping of the law will not be accepted, <hi>becauſe of the exactneſſe of the Law,</hi> it requires <hi>full, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, perfect</hi> fulfilling and obedience, or all ſtands for nothing; If this were throughly weighed and layd to heart, we ſhould come to an iſſue in the point. Mark that word, Gal. 3.12. <hi>Curſed is every
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170425:46"/>
one, that continueth not in all things which are written in the law to do them;</hi> I think I opened this place lately, but mark it well; The law requires of every one, and therefore of thee, who ever thou art, a <hi>continuance,</hi> (without intermiſſion) of <hi>doing</hi> (not only purpoſing and endeavouring) <hi>All things,</hi> not keeping nine, and breaking one Commandement; not keeping it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and breaking it in thy <hi>thoughts</hi> of ſin, but in <hi>All things,</hi> or <hi>Curſed,</hi> without remedy, by the law; The law can give you no remedy, ſee Rom. 10.5. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe of the law; The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> If he <hi>doth</hi> all the things of the law, not purpoſeth them onely, but doth them, he ſhall <hi>live</hi> by them, but not otherwiſe, but ſhall dye, and that for ever, by the law; now mark you, The ſame law can't at once juſtifie and condemn, bleſſe and curſe, quit and judge, ſave and condemn, if it therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in the leaſt, it cannot quit by all that ever a ſoul hath done, or may do, towards fulfilling it. I inſtanced before; If a man that lives under the law of <hi>England,</hi> all the laws of it, and he be found a tranſgreſſour of one law, that is to be puniſhed with death; it will not be a good plea for him, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brake any other law that deſerves death: no, ſaith the Judge, you muſt dye for this; ſo as I have ſhew'd, the law pronounceth death to the breach of any <hi>one</hi> Commandement, any part of one, as well as to the breach of the whole. Therefore he that pleads, as the Phariſee did, (and was never the more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) that he is no murderer, no blaſphemer, no thief, no adulterer; tis all one, if thou haſt ever had an unholy thought in thy heart, (as thou haſt had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands), as thou art under the law, thou art condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170425:46"/>
If this indeed had bin the tenour of the law, as it was a Covenant, between God and the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that if thou and thy poſterity ſhall endeavour to keep the law as well as you can, though you fail in ſome part, yet you ſhall be accepted; then this had bin a good plea before God, that you have ſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to keep it; but tis not ſo, the Covenant doth not run ſo, but as hath bin ſhewd it runs thus. Here's a holy and righteous law, ſaith God, the matter of the Covenant between us, If you break it in any one leaſt part of it, and but once, you are condemn'd, and all your other righteouſneſſe ſhall not be imputed to you. This ſaith bin proved from ſeverall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and I think tis the hardeſt thing in the world to be ſpiritually and practically convinced of it; ſuch is the exactneſſe of the Law, that it admits of no bartering, of no termes whatſoever; it ſtill cryes, fullfill me to the utmoſt, or dye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Reaſon, which ſtrikes off all hope of acceptance with God, by keeping the Law as well as you can, is taken <hi>from the ſinfulneſſe of thoſe very duties and workes which you place ſuch acceptance in;</hi> There is an infinite ſinfulneſſe in every ſuch duty, though the matter of the duty be good, yet the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing it by any naturall man is wholly ſinfull, yea there's a mixture of ſin in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performances of any regenerate ſoul in the world, which he is ſenſible of; but I am dealing with the naturall man, as to his opinion of his good keeping the law, I ſay there's nothing but ſin in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, the principle they proceed from is wholly ſinfull, <hi>viz.</hi> a corrupted, polluted heart and nature; Can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. Can a corrupt fountain ſend forth ſweet waters?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170425:47"/>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.11. No more can a corrupt defiled heart bring forth any duty or work, but what is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to God, full of all impurity; This a naturall man is not able to ſee, nor conſider of, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by the holy Ghoſt, and therefore 'tis, that he reſts onely in performing the matter and bulk of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God and his neighbour; but with what heart, and the unholineſſe of it, he weights not. Upon this account it is, that the Scriptures ſpeak at ſuch a rate of naturall men, that they are an <hi>abomination</hi> to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. that his <hi>ſoul hates them,</hi> he <hi>cannot away with them, they are iniquity, they are a trouble to him,</hi> Iſay 1. And that he caſts them back, <hi>as dung upon their faces,</hi> Mal. 2.3. Therefore if there be more then ſin enough, in that beſt keeping of the Law, towards God or man to damn a ſoul for ever; Certainly a ſoul ſhall be never the better, nor at all accepted for ſuch a keeping of it. That which in it ſelf hath ſin, nothing but ſin in the manner of it, cannot be a means to quit a ſoul from other ſin, by which he hath brought guilt upon himſelf; Let this be well conſidered, and (Nothing but a Chriſt) would be your cry to purpoſe indeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth reaſon or convincement of this truth, that the beſt endeavour to keep the law, will not give you more acceptance with God, nor take away any guilt from off the ſoul, is, becauſe, <hi>ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and keeping the</hi> Law, <hi>are but of the outward man,</hi> which is farre from reaching the Compaſſe of the law: <hi>the law is spirituall,</hi> Rom. 7.14. that is, it reacheth to the inward parts, to the motions of the heart, as hath bin before hinted, and not onely to the outward man; therefore our bleſſed Lord, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170425:47"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> inſiſting ſo much that they were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blameleſſe, ſpends a large diſcourſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. to beat them off their confidence, in being outwardly righteous, and proves a man a murderer by the Law, for one wrathfull thought in his heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21, 22. Upon this conviction you have him, as oft as he ſpake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> (that we may ſee the weight of this doctrine): ſee Luke 16.19, 15. <hi>And the Phariſees alſo, who were covetous, heard all theſe things, and they derided him, And he ſaid unto them, ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knoweth your hearts, for that which is highly eſteemed amongſt men is abomination in the ſight of God;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was convincing the wickedneſſe of a covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were carnall and formall, made a ſleight matter of this, ſeeing they were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blameleſſe, and wronged no body; Aye but, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>God knoweth your hearts,</hi> and his eye is moſt upon them, and though you are outwardly righteous before men, and this is a matter highly eſteemed of among men: that you are righteous and blameleſſe, yet tis an abomination to God; ſee how ſevere the Lord is in preſſing of this, (it being the great let of his Miniſtery, and of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbling at the Goſpel, as it is with us) <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. his laſt Sermon I conceive he preacht to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Woe unto you ſcribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye make clean the out ſide of the cup and platter, but with they are full of extortion and exceſſe;</hi> ſo, with the ſame woe pronounced, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>Ye are like unto whited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, which indeed appear beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanneſſe;</hi> verſe 28. <hi>Even ſo alſo ye outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of Hypocriſie and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170425:48"/>
Mark the Lords words, <hi>within</hi> ye are thus, and thus, As if the Lord ſhould ſay, God regards not what you are <hi>outwardly,</hi> and your obſerving the law with the <hi>outward</hi> man; ſeeing you have abundance of all iniquity <hi>within,</hi> which every unregenerate ſoul in the world hath; ſo you may ſee that an <hi>outward</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law, ſtandes for nothing in the account of God, whatever it do with men and your ſelves; which you hear Jeſus Chriſt gives forth, as the mark of an <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> Now you have heard, the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires inward as well as outward perfection, perfect holineſſe <hi>within,</hi> as well as righteouſneſſe in the outward man; I verily believe, want of this convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſoul, ſends more ſoules to Hell, then any other thing in the world beſides; how confident are poor Creatures if they are a little conſciencious in dealing, and ſober, and blameleſſe to men? this you may be, and be no better then devils (as in your ſelves) in Gods account, and thy beſt Character, from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.26. is a <hi>Blind Phariſee.</hi> Every place, I fear, abounds with them: therefore this inveterate curſed plea of being outwardly blameleſſe in keeping the Law, will not in the leaſt tender you more accepted with God, but tis at the beſt but painted Hypocriſie: And yet, wretched ſouls that you are, none ſo well perſwaded of themſelves as theſe. This the fourth reaſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the beſt keeping of the Law, <hi>doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, make ſatisfaction to God for one ſin of thy ſoul,</hi> therefore tis worth nothing; Gods Juſtice is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if the ſinner be remitted, God muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the ſinner himſelf, or by another. Now all the obedience of a ſinner cannot make ſatisfaction
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170425:48"/>
to God in the leaſt, If he had the whole world to offer up to God, it could not ſatisfie him for the the wrong of one ſin; ſee that known place, Micah 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? ſhall I come before him with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyle? ſhall I give my firſt borne for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> Implying that there is nothing that a poor ſinner of himſelf can offer up to God, to make atonement or ſatisfaction to God for the leaſt ſin of his ſoul; ſhould he offer up thouſands of prayers, rivers of tears, whole ages ſpent in ſervices to God, take up to a ſevere new obedience, if you ſhould ſo take up to a new courſe as never to ſinne more all your dayes, it would not make God ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or atonement for one evil thought of thy ſoul; Now obſerve this, (for if thou art not rightly convinced of this thing, thou art loſt for ever) Tis naturally upon every man and womans heart, that hath ſinned to imagine that when they have ſinned, they can put off God, as to his diſpleaſure, with ſomething or other, they will reckon what good they have done, gone to Church, (as you ſtyle it) given Almes, bin juſt to men, or ſome ſuch thing; and the poor blind Creature imagines and pleaſeth himſelf in it that this good thus done will well enough <hi>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God</hi> for his ſins, or at leaſt he will go over ſome prayers &amp; be ſtrickt for a little while, and then they doubt not but <hi>God</hi> (becauſe alſo he preſently ſmites not with judgment) is well enough apayed, and he need no more trouble himſelf. Is not this the very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170425:49"/>
way of your hearts, hath not the word found you out?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay; <hi>why,</hi> cannot theſe duties and this obedience <hi>ſatisfie</hi> and <hi>pacifie</hi> God well enough for ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe there <hi>is ſinne mixt in them,</hi> they come from a profane heart, as is ſhew'd in the laſt reaſon, (though thou ignorantly, becauſe thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thy heart, call'ſt it a good heart): now that which is in it ſelf ſinfull, cannot ſure <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> of Gods juſtice, as well as purity of it; A <hi>finite</hi> creature cannot offer up a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable</hi> atonement to an infinite God. Suppoſe a poor man were under the guilt of treaſon &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd to dye, and he ſhould go &amp; offer up a little coorſe broken bread to the Prince, would any one think that this would ſatisfie the Prince for his treaſon? So, poor deceived creature, thou art guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and rebellion againſt the great and moſt high God, and thou comeſt and offereſt up to him, thy poor polluted broken obedience, and duties, and thinkeſt he will be ſatified with this; whereas God may in the ſame moment juſtly ſend thee to Hell for the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of them; A poor ſinfull ſoul thinkes that becauſe ſuch doings and ſervices do ſatisfie himſelf, his own conſcience, therefore he thinks they will ſatisfie God alſo; becauſe they quiet him upon any trouble for guilt, he thinks they will alſo quiet God, and take off his anger and juſtice from puniſhing him: poor creature, this thy way is thy folly, and the ready way to come under the ſevere juſtice of the Almighty, who will not thus be dealt with, nor be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170425:49"/>
thus bribed with thy curſed ſacrifices; This is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convincement of the point; All the creature can do, cannot pacifie God for one ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his beſt keeping of the law cannot juſtifie a poor ſinner before God, nor give him acceptance in the leaſt with him; till he ſees pacification another way, and takes up obedience from another principle and to another end, as we are to ſhew.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All a mans endeavour in ſetting himſelf to keep the law to the utmoſt, cannot give him acceptance with God, <hi>becauſe it cannot give life to the ſoul;</hi> Gal. 3.21. <hi>For if there had bin a law, which would have given life, verily righteouſneſſe had come by the law;</hi> Man hath procured death and weaknes upon his ſoul, and the law cannot give life, nor ſtrength to obey it. All that righteouſneſs which leavs the ſoul dead, comes to nothing: while a ſoul is under the law, and upon the fulfilling of it, (as he hopes in a good meaſure,) ſtill the ſoul is as dead as ſin left it, and void of the life of God: true, A poor ſoul thinkes himſelf alive by his legall performances, as <hi>Paul</hi> thought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. but he is <hi>dead</hi> in ſin, and under the ſentence of death by the Law, and all the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances towards the keeping of it, can never give a drop of life to ſuch a poor ſoul: they are dead works, and there's no life in them or from them: therefore they ſtand no ſoul in ſtead; while under the law, as under it he is, while he goes upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The main reaſon of all, which is now but to be touched, is this: If a ſoul endeavouring to keep the law of God as well as he can, may be accepted of God thereby, what need Jeſus Chriſt to have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170425:50"/>
dyed: tis <hi>Pauls</hi> great argument, Rom. 8.3, 4. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own ſon, in the likeneſſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſ- of the law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c. Mark ye, what the law <hi>could not</hi> do, that it could not give us a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe whereby God might accept us, therefore God ſent his ſon in the fleſh, and condemned ſinne upon him, which otherwiſe had bin condemned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſinner himſelf: Another place to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, Gal. 2. <hi>laſt, I do not fruſtrate the grace of God; for if righteouſneſſe come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> If there were a poſſibility of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attaining to ſuch a degree of keeping the law as well as he can, that might render him accepted with God, and procure pardon wherein he failed, then the dying of Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>in vain,</hi> to no purpoſe at all. Take heed you that are outwardly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that you do not fruſtrate the grace of God, and the death of Jeſus Chriſt for ever to your own ſouls, by thinking you indeavour to keep Gods law, as well as you can, and make ſome conſcience of it, and there fix your hope wholly, or in part, and ſo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. Another place in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. ſpeakes out the ſame truth. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, made under the law; To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of Sons.</hi> What need Jeſus Chriſt to have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to redeem the elect from under the law, if they had bin able to reach forth to ſuch a keeping of it, that God might be well pleaſed with, and with them in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170425:50"/>Now Jeſus Chriſts <hi>being made under the law,</hi> implyes theſe things, which I now but hint forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His being under the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the law, which was due to ſuch as were under it; what ever the law pronounced to the tranſgreſſours of it, Jeſus Chriſt in effect did undergo it; See Gal. 3. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> If good prayers, making a conſcience in dealing, outward ſobriety, harming no body, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Almes to poor people, could have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the curſe; did the wiſe and bleſſed God do well in giving out his Son to be made a curſe? were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, righteouſneſſe, good deeds, made a Curſe? They will be indeed, in another ſenſe, if thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be accepted by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt being made under the Law, was <hi>to ſatisfie Gods offending juſtice</hi> for the breach of the Law, for ſuch as ſhall be ſaved; to <hi>make atonement for God,</hi> Rom. 5.11. If now all that thou haſt done, or ſhalt ever do, could make the leaſt ſatisfaction or atonement to God, in thy good keeping the Commandements as well as thou canſt, (as hath been ſhew'd) God might have kept his Son in Heaven, and not ſent him to make atonement for any ſinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>reconcile</hi> ſinners unto God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. If reconciliation to God can be had no other way, but by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, will thy good endeavours for the time to come to keep the Law of God, as well as thou canſt, and take up from a looſe courſe, will thoſe, I ſay, reconcile
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170425:51"/>
thee to God? See, poor creature, how little need thou thinkeſt thou haſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and what a mere notion a Saviour is to thee, when it comes to the tryal!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt dyed to <hi>purchaſe righteouſneſſe,</hi> for all that ſhall be ſaved; Now if thou couldſt come up to ſuch a degree of being righteous, by thy fair and good carriage, as thou thinkeſt, to God and man, this purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſſe, to every one that believeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſee, miſtaken ſoul, how thy hope to pleaſe God well enough, and make him amends for thy ſin, by thy good endeavours to ſerve him in his law as well as thou mayſt, makes void the whole deſigne of God, in the glorious gift of his eternall Son, (as much as in thee lyeth); and robs him of the glory of his grace; and makes thy ſalvation (if it might be had in ſuch a way) not of grace, but of debt, Rom. 4.4. <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of debt but of grace;</hi> And thus thou, in effect, becomeſt thy own Saviour.</p>
               <p>Yet bear with me a little further, (becauſe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can never be too thoroughly convinced of this matter) let me ſhew you ſome <hi>examples</hi> in the Scriptures, of ſuch that thought as you do, and as all men naturally do, that they by their honeſt and conſcionable endeavour to worſhip God, and harm no body, they ſhould be ſaved; and yet were found light in the balance.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. He thanks God, <hi>he was not as other men are, Extortioners, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Aduterers,</hi> &amp;c. Here was hope for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance

Enough for great ſinners to miſſe of Heaven, and not ſuch as he was, reputed a good and honeſt man in his Country and amongſt his neighbours, well thought of by moſt. And yet for all this confidence and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a great ſinner was accepted before him, and he not juſtified in the ſight of God, though he was in his own ſight, and the ſight of others. See another; <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. (which place hath bin at large ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you), There came a young man, a man of parts, a Ruler, with the ſame confidence to reaſon with Jeſus Chriſt about his condition, The man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he wanted nothing that a man ſhould have or do for Heaven; <hi>All theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have kept from my youth up,</hi> meaning ſpecially the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law, which Chriſt gave out, not as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to put him upon the law, but to find him out, and diſcover him under the law. When Ieſus Chriſt ſearcheth the mans heart, and finds him under the power of the love of the world, as a reigning ſoul-damning ſin, (for all his outward blameleſneſſe), and ſo to diſcover his heart to himſelf, puts him upon tryall of ſelf-denyall; Away the man packs as mute as a fiſh, and would hear no more, (as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings now) of ſuch doctrine; unleſſe he could be a diſciple and part with nothing, loſe or venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he would reſt as he was, and hope his being an honeſt ſober man, and well thought of, would bring him to Heaven; and ſo, for ought appears, cheated his ſoul to Hell.</p>

Jer. 7.

               <p>In this caſe Ieſus Chriſt findes the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in, at his firſt coming in reſting in ſome heartleſs perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in Gods worſhip, and outward righteouſneſs towards men, which he ſharply rebuketh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineth them of the vanity of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25. <hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Mathew,</hi> with which you may compare the other Evangeliſts, and ſee how much ado the Lord Jeſus had to beat them off from this confidence, and how few of them were beaten off it: and <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth that upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170425:55"/>
ground, they were rejected of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. Not upon the account of groſſe outward ſin, but for their being conceited of their good condition for heaven, becauſe of their frequenting publique worſhip, and being blameleſſe in the ſight of men; yea, from this naturall principle (joyned with the deluſion of the tempter) did the Church of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the Synagogue of Satan, as Antichriſt roſe in the world, firſt truſting in the performance of their worſhip and workes, which brought in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and ſuch kind of Sacriledge againſt Ieſus Chriſt, and all other tromperies, to build fallen man upon his own bottome, and to deviſe a way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God wherein they failed; to which the hearts of men are moſt naturally carryed, which made that doctrine ſo eaſily and generally overrunne the world. Againſt which accurſed doctrine, that famous witneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Luther</hi> began his main battery; And though the doctrine of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ieſus Chriſt be known to the proteſtant world; yet practically to be brought over to it, by an union with Ieſus Chriſt, is but, (we may fear) thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known or underſtood, yea not onely by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpirits of <hi>England,</hi> that reſt in a notion of being <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but even amongſt many who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſomething beyond it, as I before have hinted; yea the Lord Ieſus Chriſt profeſſeth to expect to find multitudes of profeſſours at his coming under this ſoul-damning ſnare, of being <hi>found in themſelves,</hi> and in their own righteouſneſſe, and not in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; Mat.</hi> 25. &amp;c. By all which it may am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply appear how <hi>eaſie,</hi> how <hi>naturall</hi> a thing it is for the hearts of the Children of men, to bottome
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170425:56"/>
their confidence in what they <hi>do</hi> towards God and man, in their <hi>obedience</hi> of the law, as to place their <hi>acceptance</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>Adde to this the reaſons of it, why the hearts of all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> are naturally apt to reſt upon the law, and their own doings, and to hope for peace by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every naturall man, hath ſomething of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> of the law, which God at firſt wrote in the heart of our common Father <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. which being a little drawn forth by the Letter of the Law, it makes a poor creature ſet himſelf to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep the law, and hopes to attain to ſuch a degree as to be accepted with God for it; Now there is no ſuch thing as any remote profeſſion in the heart to come to Chriſt, or to have righteouſnes in another; therefore, a ſoul ſets himſelf to the law, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, more or leſſe, the keeping of it, naturally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man would faign make up the breach he hath made with God, <hi>upon his own account;</hi> As a man had naturally rather do a thing himſelf, then be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to another; therefore upon conviction of guilt he ſets himſelf to make up the breach, to ſatisfie God by ſome atonement or other, that his own heart can contrive; his ſorrowing and repenting he hopes may pacifie God, or ſome new ſacrifice of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, or being better for the time to come: thus the heart workes ſecretly, and upon his own account; God letting forth ſome mercy (as he thinks) where he failes, he hopes to make up any breach that ſin hath made between God and his ſoul; and thus he is ſtill upon the Old Covenant, under the law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſinner is more apt to keep to the law, then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170425:56"/>
go to Chriſt, <hi>from a ſecret pride of heart;</hi> he would not be found at a <hi>totall loſſe</hi> with God, to be wholly <hi>undone,</hi> and <hi>unable</hi> to do any thing towards his own peace, and ſalvation; A ſoul naturally had rather part withall ſin, and have his nature made perfectly holy, then be quite undone in himſelf, and come to have all his righteouſneſſe in another, in Jeſus Chriſt. And here it is, that moſt ſouls ſtick in the coming off their own bottoms, to be juſtified in Ieſus Chriſt. In a word, man had rather do any thing then come a poor deſtitute ſinner to Jeſus Chriſt for all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe tis not ſutable to the light of naturall reaſon, that a ſoul ſhould ſatisfie God, or become righteous any other way, then by his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; To be righteous in another, is of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which till a ſoul hath, he cannot let go the principle of ſelf-juſtification.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered will be this, If all men are under the law, and the curſe of it, under the guilt of the whole law, without all excuſe before God, under an impoſſibility of attaining righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or acceptance with God, by the beſt keeping of the law, and yet a natural and ſtrong aptitude to reſt upon the law, and that a ſoul may reforme and take up, be ſtrict in obedience, and yet ſtill be under the law; how then may a ſoul know whether in the way of his obedience, he be yet under the law, and not under grace? Some Diſcoveries I ſhall lay down at preſent, reſerving a fuller diſcuſſion of this.</p>
               <p>And by the way, know and conſider, that though thou art under the profeſſion of the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and pretendeſt ſalvation by him, yet pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically and really thou mayeſt be ſtill under the law.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170425:57"/>1. If thou haſt never bin convinc'd of this cloſe evil in thy heart, of reſting on thy praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and endeavouring to keep the law as well as thou canſt, I ſay, if the ſpirit of the Lord hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thee of it, and of the great danger of it, and ſo humbled thee, and brought thee off it, thou art cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly under the law as yet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou doeſt not <hi>watch</hi> againſt this evil, and doeſt not find a great <hi>difficulty,</hi> not to reſt upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any duty to God, thou doeſt then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>rest</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If thou art well ſatisfied, that thou art kept from <hi>outward</hi> groſſe ſins; and the ſin of thy nature is not thy <hi>greateſt burthen,</hi> mourning under the weight of it, then thou muſt know that thou art yet under the law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If thou thinkeſt God will accept of the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> if thou doeſt as well as thou canſt in every duty, ſo as to <hi>accept</hi> thee <hi>thereby,</hi> as if it had bin done perfectly; this alſo beſpeakes thee under the Law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If thou canſt not <hi>experience,</hi> how the Lord by the light and working of his word and ſpirit hath brought thee off thy legall foundation thou waſt building upon, and ſhew'd thee, that ſuch things as thou didſt account <hi>gain,</hi> became but <hi>loſſe</hi> unto thee, <hi>for Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If thou art not troubled about the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> of thy heart, and not abaſed for it, even in thy beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; then thou art yet upon the bottome of the law, and reſteſt in it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If thou art not moſtly troubled about <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> and doeſt not find it the moſt difficult work of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170425:57"/>
thy ſoul, If no complaint to God of an unbelieving heart, then thou art indeed a Hypocrite, and under the law.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If thou art not humbled to God for the <hi>ſinfull mixtures</hi> of thy dutyes, the deadneſſe, diſtraction, of them, and ſo ſeeſt thy acceptance cannot be in them, but in Jeſus Chriſt, then thou reſteſt in them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If thou doſt not give up thy ſelf to the <hi>leadings</hi> of the Spirit, and doeſt not find, that, in the main of thy courſe, thou art <hi>led</hi> by the Spirit, then thou art under the law, Gal. 3.18. <hi>But if ye are led by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye are not under the law.</hi>

               <p n="11">11. If thy care be not to live in the ſenſe of thy juſtification by grace through Jeſus Chriſt, and to preſerve the light and peace of a <hi>juſtified ſtate,</hi> which thou haſt bin called to by grace; then thou liveſt in ſelf-juſtification.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If thy <hi>great care</hi> be not, if thou findeſt it not thy <hi>greatest difficulty,</hi> to be kept a poor empty creature in thy ſelf, and live in the fulneſſe of Chriſt, If ſelf-fulneſſe, ſelf-exaltation, be not the great evils thou watcheſt againſt, (at leaſt in ſome meaſure, thou art ſenſible of the roots of them), then thou art yet under all I have bin proving, the law, guilt, and a curſe; and all thy duties and doings, as I have ſhew'd, abhorred of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:170425:58"/>Examine thy heart by theſe particulars over and over, and if by theſe thou canſt not make out that thou haſt bin, through rich grace, brought off from thy own foundation upon the law, and ſo come, with much difficulty, to the Goſpel-grace and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by Jeſus Chriſt, and that if thou hadſt bin let alone in peace in thy former ſtate, thou hadſt bin certainly damned; ſure thou art then as yet void of any intereſt in the Goſpel ſaving righteouſneſſe; thy pretended faith, and hope, and duties, and workes, and conſcience, all's in vain.</p>
               <p>Now the ſoul that hath the bleſſed experience of all theſe, and can ſay, I have through infinite mercy bin brought off my own foundation, &amp; I have found the difficulty of it, I find my heart apt to ſettle upon my own performances, and tis that I would watch againſt; And I can experience the ſin of my Nature the greateſt burthen, and cry out of it daily before the Lord; The Hypocriſie of my heart is an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to men, I do find believing the hardeſt work of my ſoul, I do mourn under the ſinfull mixture of my duties, I do give up my ſelf to the ſpirits lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, I am troubled about my inward growth, and humbled for the ſhortneſſe of it, I would learn more and more to live out of my ſelf for my juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and be kept a poor empty nothing for ever before the Lord; If this, I ſay, be thy experienc, then thou ſhalt have peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt; Thou mayſt rejoyce in a juſtified eſtate, Chriſt, his righteouſneſſe, grace, ſpirit, heaven are thine.</p>
               <p>Having now laid open the ſinner, as under the law, excuſeleſs, guilty and under condemnation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an impoſſibility of obtaining righteouſneſſe and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170425:58"/>
acceptance with God, by the beſt endeavours to keep the Law, I would now ſet upon the opening the Goſpel-righteouſneſſe, by Jeſus Chriſt, through which onely a poor condemned ſinner can find acceptance; but that I conceive it firſt needfull to ſpeak a word to thoſe words in the cloſe of the 22. <hi>verſe,</hi> (viz.) <hi>for there is no difference;</hi> which may further help on the conviction we have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iew</hi> might object to the Apoſtle thus; you by your doctrine ſeem to conclude <hi>all</hi> under the Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, and under guilt; you make no difference between us <hi>Iews</hi> who have the Law, and endeavour to keep it, and the open profane Gentiles and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; In this, you do us wrong; No, ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>There's no difference,</hi> you who <hi>in part</hi> keep the Law, are under the ſame condemnation as others; That which I ſhall lay down, will be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> There is no difference between the moſt profane perſon, and the righteous and ſober, as to juſtification or condemnation by the law.</p>
               <p>I mean this; The juſt ſober man, as to his keeping of the Law outwardly or in part, is in as damnable eſtate as the profaneſt wretch in the world; This will hardly go down, but tis moſt clear from the Apoſtle's words, readd unto you, and hath been in part proved, by ſhewing all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> Jews and Gentiles, ſober and ungodly, all; under the Law.</p>
               <p>But a little further to proſecute this doctrine; for, were a man or woman, who hath lived honeſtly and ſoberly in the eye of the world, (but yet out of Chriſt) convinced that he or ſhe were in as bad and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170425:59"/>
damnable a condition as any great ſinner in the world, it might be a ſtartling to them, and a means, through the Spirit's working, to bring them off their vain confidence, and to lead them to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that I may clear this, let us firſt conſider, what it was that might difference the ſober <hi>Jew,</hi> from the profane Idolatrous Gentile; it being the ſame, which ſuch, as conceive themſelves ſober harmeleſſe people in this day, do put confidence in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jew</hi> was <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> which was the firſt Ordinance of the old Teſtament-Church, as Baptiſm is of the New, and to be adminiſtred to the ſeed of the Church: and it doth appear this was much inſiſted on by the <hi>Jew,</hi> by what the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 18.19. For <hi>he is not a</hi> Jew <hi>who is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh, but he is a</hi> Jew <hi>which is one inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They had the Scriptures of God, Rom. 3.2. <hi>Unto them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> which indeed the Apoſtle calls an <hi>advantage,</hi> (in the ſame place), as it might be a <hi>meanes</hi> to lead them to the knowledge of God, and to the promiſe of Ieſus Chriſt, but no advantage at all, (as to the mere ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them read and opened, and in a generall faith, believing them) as the more to <hi>juſtifie</hi> them in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Iews were under the <hi>publique ſervice</hi> of God, ſuch as was ordained by God himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were for the moſt part righteous to men and ſober, and blameleſſe in the outward man; <hi>Ye
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170425:59"/>
indeed are they which are righteous before men;</hi> as the Lord often ſpeaks of them; Now 'tis moſt clear, that theſe things did not difference the Iew, as to accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God and Ieſus Chriſt, from the moſt profane ſinner; for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt rejected theſe and call'd to himſelf Publicans and Harlots, and tells the Iews that ſuch ſhould <hi>enter into the Kingdome of God before them,</hi> Math. 21.31. As might be further inſtanced in the caſe of the Phariſee and Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9.</p>
               <p>Now the Reaſons of this point have bin before hinted, namely, that a mere ſober man under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian priviledges, is no more accepted with Chriſt, nor in any nearer capacity to come to Chriſt, then the greateſt ſinner; becauſe one ſin puts a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation of the law, as well as a million of ſins againſt it; one felony condemns a man as well as a thouſand, and the malefactor muſt dye, by the law, for it. All the good a man doth, will not be <hi>imputed</hi> to him, if he be found a tranſgreſſour in one part of the Law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. All men come ſhort of the glory of God, in the fulfilling of the Law, and he that falls ſhort but in one mile is in as bad a caſe as he that falls ſhort twenty miles; Jeſus Chriſt accepts of no man for his righteouſneſſe but as a ſinner, nothing elſe but a ſinner; ſo that ſtill the caſe of a juſt man, in reference to the Law, is as dangerous as the greateſt ſinner's in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> A little further to preſſe this; you who are baptiſed, have a generall belief of the Scriptures, are under part of the publique ſervice of God, are juſt and harmleſſe as to men; but yet are under the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of unbelief</hi> and ſee it not, are not born again of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170425:60"/>
the Spirit, are not in Chriſt Jeſus: you who reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in ſuch a condition, and think your hope for Heaven well-grounded, and will not be beaten off it, I muſt tell you, and 'tis proved unto your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from the Word of the Lord, that <hi>there's no difference</hi> between you, and the vileſt ſinners in the Countrey, as to your acceptance with God: Though it be thus with you, yet, as you have been ſhewed, you may be under the Law, condemned for one tranſgreſſion: and what can you be more then be condemned? Neither doth all this, as in it ſelf, any more prepare you for Jeſus Chriſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all the Convictions, Arguments, Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations we have produced from the clear Light of the Word of the Lord at laſt prevail with you, that you who thus <hi>ſatisfie</hi> your ſelves, becauſe you are baptized, believe the Scriptures, frequent the ſervice of God, are juſt and ſober, therefore it is well with you, and you will trouble your ſelves no further in the matter of your ſalvation, that the eſtate of your ſoules is as unſafe and deſperate, how ſecure ſoever, as the profoundeſt Drunkard in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let this Conviction have force upon your Conſcience, that you muſt come anew to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as <hi>a mere ſinner,</hi> having nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to him.</p>
               <p>Say, from the Light of the Word, Though I have thus ſatisfied my ſelf, pleas'd my ſelf, in theſe Duties and outward Priviledges; yet <hi>there's no difference</hi> between me and the vileſt ſinner, in order to my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with Jeſus Chriſt. Nay, if this Conviction take upon thee, thou wilt ſay to the glory of God, and thy own confuſion; If there be any difference,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170425:60"/>
'tis, that thou art the greateſt ſinner, having mocked the Lord, reſted in out-ſide ſervice, dealt hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with the jealous God, offered him abominable ſacrifice, and therefore fit to be abhorred of the Lord for ever: Oh! that this might be the poſture of thy Soul! and ſo thou mayeſt come and lye proſtrate at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, crying, Oh! no more, no more, a righteous perſon! but a ſinner, a guilty ſinner, a condemned ſinner, a poor, blind, naked ſinner; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſinner! Away with all my former confidences; tear them from my heart Lord. Now Lord Jeſus I caſt my ſelf upon thee; Oh! let me creep unto thy bleſſed feet! Oh! I come to thee: not becauſe I am righteous, (for I would abhor my ſelf for ever in the thought of it) but as a poor peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſinner, the worſt of ſinners, an hypocritical ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Oh! that I could take hold of thy <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to cover my naked Soul: I expect it onely upon the account of thy <hi>Free-Grace;</hi> Oh Lord I come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, do not, do not, reject me.</p>
               <p>And thus have I been endeavouring to lay the ſinner before Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a poſture; having proved him, under the Law, excuſeleſs in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of it, guilty before God, under an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reaching to an acceptance with God, by the beſt keeping of the Law; laboured to beat him off ſuch props and confidences, that the Heart naturally cleaves to, and ſtript him of all, naked as <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had ſinned before the Lord, as <hi>nothing elſe but a ſinner,</hi> which is that I have driven at. I now come to ſpeak of the way of a poor Souls juſtification, and acceptance with God, by Jeſus Chriſt, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt, to the capacity of the weakeſt.</p>

               </q>
               <p>We have endeavoured, in the former Diſcourſe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170425:61"/>
to go along with the Apoſtle, in proving, that by all the Deeds of the Law, all the beſt Obedience that a ſinner can reach unto, he cannot be juſtified before God, neither in part, nor in whole, that your good deeds will not procure pardon, nor poiſe down your ſins, but all, by the Law, equally under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Of what importance then is it for poor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoules to be well acquainted with, and really and practically inveſted in that way of juſtification, that God in infinite wiſdome, mercy, and love, hath ſet forth in the Goſpel, which is that I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles arguing is thus: If all fall ſhort of righteouſneſs, and acceptance with God by their own obedience: If all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, then are all, and that equally, condemned: If ſo condemned, then acceptance with God, and juſtification, and remiſſion of ſinnes muſt come in another way: The Riſe and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of which, muſt neceſſarily be Gods free mercy and grace: If made righteous, it muſt be in the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of another, wrought forth by <hi>another:</hi> Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied by <hi>another,</hi> a price paid to God for a ſinners redemption by <hi>another,</hi> which is, Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>From the words then, I ſhall firſt lay down this plain Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>Gods free mercy and grace is the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of any ſinners ſalvation;</hi> or, <hi>'Tis upon the account of 'Gods free grace, that any ſinner is ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:170425:62"/>Thus runs the current of the whole Goſpel, the main deſign of the Goſpel being to glorifie the riches of Gods free grace by Jeſus Chriſt: Among many other Scriptures, the Apoſtle doth moſt convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from the 15th to the end: letting the free grace of God unto juſtification, in oppoſition to a ſinners condemnation: <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift; for if through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> To the ſame import, run the reſt of the verſes, <hi>The free gift of many unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Christ:</hi> All of <hi>grace,</hi> and of <hi>free-gift, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace,</hi> from firſt to laſt: <hi>That as ſin reigned unto death, ſo might grace reign through righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> verſ. laſt. So the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Doctrine of grace is bleſſedly given forth, drives all <hi>the ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt,</hi> mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. &amp;c. to this bleſſed <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Chap.</hi> 2.4. &amp;c. <hi>But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt (for by grace ye are ſaved)</hi> ſo ver. 7. <hi>That in the Ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace;</hi> and ver. 8. <hi>For by grace ye are ſaved, it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the invitation of the Goſpel to ſinners runs upon this ſcore: Ho, <hi>Every one that thirſteth, come to the Waters of Life,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. And, <hi>Whoſoever
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170425:62"/>
will, let him come to the Water of Life freely,</hi> Revel. 22.17.</p>
               <p>I might illuſtrate this in all the particulars of a ſinners ſalvation, God's fore-ordaining and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any to ſalvation, 'twas <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1.5, 6. The gift of his Eternal Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, from free love and grace, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. The New Covenant, and all the Promiſes of it, freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out for his <hi>own Names</hi> ſake, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. Effectuall Calling, from free grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. The gift of Faith, actual Juſtification, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. Sanctification, Perſeverance, Eternal Life and Glory, all flowing from the ſame Fountain of Free-grace: Some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Deſign of the Bleſſed God in this, may be gathered from the Scriptures:</p>
               <p>The Free-grace of God is the Fountain of all, in any ſinners ſalvation;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, <hi>There is nothing in the Creature that may move God to ſave him:</hi> Nothing at all, All we know or do, could not move God to mercy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, becauſe you were more in number then any people, but becauſe he freely loved you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not for your ſake do I do this,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 36.32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God ſaw nothing in him, ſo the ſinner is <hi>able to bring nothing to God,</hi> to draw out mercy of his own: Therefore, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. let him come without his price: As the ſinner loſt all his good, ſo he can procure none a new to bring to God, that may in the leaſt move the heart of God to give out more to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it were not all of grace, <hi>then the Creature would have occaſion of boaſting;</hi> but the Lord in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170425:63"/>
wiſdome, ſo laid the Project of a ſinners Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Creature ſhould have the leaſt ground of boaſting: So the Apoſtle having given out the Doctrine of grace in this Scripture we are upon, draws this concluſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded,</hi> &amp;c. So in the 1 of <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt lays down this as the main ſcope of God in the Goſpel: That, <hi>No Fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence:</hi> Therefore Salvation is all of grace of Free-grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it were not ſo, <hi>The glory of God would not be ſo great in the Salvation of a ſinner:</hi> 'Tis now ſo laid, that all might be, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. It being the higheſt piece of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Wiſe and Bleſſed God did ever deſign unto himſelf, that his free, rich, abundant, infinite grace, might be made known in the Salvation of a Sinner: <hi>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If Gods Free-grace be the Fountain of all in a poor ſinners Salvation, then let it eſtabliſh our judgments in this Doctrine: Therefore God had no reſpect to any fore-ſight of Faith or Works in the Creature; God had no reſpect to the freeneſſe of his Will, for he knew he had none: God had no reſpect to any conditions to be wrought in us; but all he did, and doth, was from abſolute Independing-grace: Nothing moved him but his own Free-grace. The ſame Free-grace that pardons, <hi>gives,</hi> and <hi>workes</hi> all in us; All from the ſame Fountain.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:170425:63"/>2. If all be of Free-grace, then there is no meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious-procuring Cauſe in us, that moves the Lord to mercy: Now the contrary is naturally rooted in our hearts; poor Soules are moſt apt to conceive, that if they can grieve for their ſins, repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, this will ſure move God to mercy and pardon. A moſt dangerous ſnare, from which a Soul, after much conviction, is hardly wrought off: Now, though God in the way of a Sinners Salvation, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. and a <hi>Spirit of mourning for ſinne:</hi> yet a poor Soul muſt take heed that he make not this a procuring cauſe of Pardon: Many a Soul ſticks here, before <hi>emptyed</hi> of himſelf, even of his very repenting, and ſo come for grace and mercy, upon the account of the Free-promiſe onely: How many a Sinner might have been ſaved, if he would have been ſaved freely?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God hath ſo laid the Deſign to ſave a Sinner freely, then how great, how juſt is the Condemnation of guilty ſinners that will not haſten in unto it: how could the Lord have laid it more freely then he hath? Oh that any ſinner, for ever condemned to Hell without it, ſhould withſtand it! Why ſinner? Shall the Bleſſed God, that might have much glory in condemning thee to all Eternity, be willing to ſave thee freely; and wilt thou not come and bow unto him, &amp; accept of it? All the contempt of God, in all his Holy Commands, is not like this, to turn the back upon Free-Mercy, Free-Salvation: This will be the Worm that never dyes to any of your Soules that ſhall not come into, and rightly accept of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſalvation, that you might have been ſaved freely, have had grace, remiſſion of ſins, Jeſus Chriſt, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

Eternal Life freely, and yet turned your backs upon it? But you may demand, How is it that any ſinner doth ſo? What is it that cauſeth any Soul to forego Free-grace and mercy when held out unto him; that we may beware of ſuch hinderances?</p>
               <p>I will therefore ſhew you ſuch Hinderances that keep Soules from accepting of Gods free grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, when held out unto them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wilful Obſtinacy,</hi> Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that you might have life: Ye will not;</hi> ſuch is the ſtubbornneſs &amp; rebellion of the heart of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he will not, as we ſpeak, becauſe he will not: to ſuch a height hath ſinne raiſed the heart of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious children of men; for, every natural man, till made ſenſible of unbelief, thinks he hath Power of himſelf, (though he hath not), but his Rebellion lyes in his Will: <hi>I would have gathered you, and ye would not,</hi> Mat. 23. laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſinner doth not accept of Free-grace, <hi>becauſe he ſtands upon his ſelf-juſtification,</hi> (as we uſe to ſpeak) he will not be perſwaded he hath ſo much need of all Free-grace, as the Goſpel diſcovers; as hath been ſhewed at large; though he hath ſinned, yet alſo he hath obeyed, and ſo he puts one againſt the other, his obedience againſt his ſin, and ſo hopes to get that mercy he hath need of. And upon this ground, more ſinners, even that profeſs the Name of God, do miſs of Heaven then any other in the World: 'Tis not ſo eaſie a matter to ſubmit to Gods Free-grace alone, as many do imagine: Upon this Snare, many of the Jewiſh Profeſſours of Chriſt fell ſhort; as 'tis clear
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170425:64"/>
from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and did fruſtrate the grace of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſinner hath a ſecret thought of <hi>making God ſatisfaction,</hi> by his ſorrow and amendment, and ſo makes void the Free-grace of God: 'Tis the eaſieſt thing in the World to put up legal ſorrow and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life to God, as that which may make God amends; yea, to make an <hi>atonement</hi> of every Duty, which is the cloſeſt and moſt deſperate evil of the heart: ſo did the Jew by his ſacrifices and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which cauſed the Lord to pronounce of them, <hi>That his ſoul loathed them,</hi> Iſa. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A ſinner doth not ſavingly cloſe with free grace, <hi>from a ſecret pride of heart,</hi> he would not be found ſo poor, and helpleſs, ſo unrighteous &amp; ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to be beholden to free mercy for all; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons will rather ſtarve then beg, then live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another mans mercy: 'tis ſo between a ſinner and the Lord, till God humble him, hee'd rather venture Hell then come and acknowledge utter condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing but ſin upon him, and ſo ſtoop to free mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſinner ſtands off from free-grace, <hi>becauſe he will make his own termes:</hi> he will <hi>condition</hi> for his carnall eaſe, his ſelf-intereſt, his boſome luſt, the love of the world, and hopes God will allow him his termes, which he propoſeth to himſelf; and herein he is ruined. Now God hath drawn up the tenour of his free grace in the way of a Covenant, and though there are no conditions left to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170425:65"/>
to make good on his part, by his own power, (for that will eaſily imply a ſelf-ſufficiency in him, and is abſolutely derogatory from the grace of God in the Goſpel-Covenant,) yet God hath drawn up (as I may ſo ſpeak) what other good things he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on the ſubjects of his free grace, Namely, The Law to be new written in their hearts, the gift of the Spirit, Newneſſe of heart, with the making good of all thoſe promiſes, in a degree, that hold forth holineſſe and new obedience, which muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the free pardon of ſins, and make indeed, the free grace of God more glorious; Inaſmuch as when he pardons them he will ſave them from the ſervice of ſin, work his Image upon them, bring them to a bleſſed conformity to himſelf: which conſidered aright, ſweetens and heightens the free grace of God, and makes the termes of it more bleſſed; In a word, Mercy and holineſſe muſt go together, A Saviour and Sanctifier, which a ſinner from the curſed love of eaſe and ſatisfaction to his luſts ſticks at, and ſo comes not up to Gods termes, (which are bleſſed and holy) and ſo miſſeth of grace and mercy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe he chooſeth ſinne rather then holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yea a ſinner (and I ſpeak all this while of ſuch as pretend to an intereſt in free mercy) miſſeth of this grace, <hi>becauſe he takes up the termes of God, in his Covenant of grace, in his own ſtrength,</hi> will repent, and come up to new obedience before he comes to the promiſe, to the free grace of God for it; which is alſo a dangerous ſnare. A ſinner's firſt work, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced as we have opened), is to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170425:65"/>
upon the free grace of God, for all, to give all, to work all, and ſo to follow <hi>God</hi> by vertue of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of ſuch good and grace as the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant holds forth; Tis an uſuall thing for poor ſouls firſt to think to convert themſelves, make themſelves holy, and then come to <hi>God,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt, this is an indirect courſe, Oh! a poor ſoul muſt begin at the fountain of <hi>Gods</hi> free grace, for Chriſt, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for the Spirit, for converſion, for holineſſe, for all, as held out in promiſes, and then the worke will be ſure and proſper, and nought ſhall hinder it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sinners fail of this free grace of <hi>God,</hi> from a neglect and ſleighting of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall you eſcape if you neglect ſo great a ſalvation?</hi> Sinners do hear that, though they are ſinners and condemned, in a damnable eſtate, yet Jeſus Chriſt will ſave them; if they will come unto him, fit them for heaven, and do it himſelf for them, and in them: yet, through a deſperate folly, ſecurity, and careleſs temper, the heart being in a dead ſleep, they wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly neglect it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From the power of unbelief, which they are under, and ſee it not.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhew'd thoſe ſpeciall hinderances that cauſe poor ſouls that hear of Goſpel-grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and for ever to miſſe of it.</p>
               <p>Oh that this word of the Lord, might find you out, and might be as a glaſſe to ſhew you your own hearts; you who by a willfull obſtinacy, have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Goſpell-calls hitherto, Oh! now fall down before the Lord, and cry, I yeeld, I yeeld, thou bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> thy patience, thy freeſt grace hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170425:66"/>
me; Lord take away a rebellious obſtinate heart from me: Ah Lord! Thou haſt waited to be gracious; and Chriſt, and Mercy, and Heaven have been offered to ſo vile a Wretch freely: Now, Lord, I throw my ſelf at thy feet, a thouſand Hells are too good for me: but if grace, infinite grace, be free, there's yet hope for me. If there be not grace enough in Heaven for me, let me go to the depth of Hell: but, Lord, I take hold of thee, I deſire to do it. Oh, do thou take hold of me, and I ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>You who have ſtood upon your terms, and hoped you had Righteouſneſs enough to cover you, and <hi>God</hi> would look upon that, and not upon your ſin, you are the moſt abominable in God's ſight: you, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in your hearts think your ſorrowing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, makes God amends: you who have wrapt your ſelves in theſe Cobwebs, and through pride of heart, will not lay them down; Oh! if thou wilt have mercy, thou muſt have all in a way of mercy and grace; all freely, or nothing at all: ſee all thy righteouſneſs made void by one ſin againſt the Law, and therefore curſed and condemned by it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt no Plea but free mercy and grace: Oh lay down all thy other Pleas, they will never be heard in Heaven! and now cry out, Oh 'tis of grace! proud ſelfiſh Wretch that I have been; 'tis all of free grace, if ever I am ſaved: If God cannot pardon free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beſtow Jeſus Chriſt freely, I am undone for ever: Oh the wicked caſtings of my heart this way and that way! Oh there's nothing, nothing, but infinite miſ ry to move mercy! All my goodneſs is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing, as from my ſelf: there's an infinite
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170425:66"/>
Fountain of ſin and ſelf-righteouſneſs in men: Oh could I come to an infinite Fountain of grace! Thus thou wilt come to God, when he ſhall ſmite thy heart. Which now look up unto him to do.</p>
               <p>You who have been making your own terms of eaſe, and luſts, and world; Oh render up your hearts to the gracious, bleſſed, holy terms, that God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: Why ſhould'ſt thou not be willing to be made holy? Why ſhould not the Lord rather rule thee, then ſin and the Devil? What more beautiful and glorious then the Image of God? Oh accept of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs with mercy, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! Come unto him for both; be willing to be ſet apart for God, a Veſſel purged and ſanctified for his uſe, and thou ſhalt behold the face of God ſhining upon thee; and whatever is laid up in Chriſt, in Promiſes, in Heaven and glory, ſhall be thine.</p>
               <p>You who have thought to make your ſelves holy, and then come to Chriſt to be juſtified: be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of your great errour, and now come as ſinners to Jeſus Chriſt to be juſtified and ſanctified in him, and ſee all grace laid up in Jeſus Chriſt for ſuch as come unto him. Say, Oh bleſſed Lord Jeſus, I cannot fit my ſelf for thee! If thou canſt not accept me as a poor undone helpleſs ſinner coming unto thee, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect a bleſſing from thee.</p>
               <p>And you who have ſleighted this free, and rich, and glorious grace, ſee what you have done, and be abaſed for it: ſee how you caſt back mercy upon the face of God, who would freely be reconciled with you, paſs by all the grievous injuries you have done him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Covenant with you, beſtow his Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, fit you for communion with himſelf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170425:67"/>
here, and for ever: and all this you have ſleighted, and yet muſt unavoidably be for ever damned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: Sinner, who can plead for thee, when thou ſhalt go on to deſpiſe, neglect, ſleight ſuch grace? To Hell, without pitty of God, Angels, or Men, when freeſt mercy and grace ſhall be ſleighted.</p>
               <p>I do therefore ſtand this day in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to acquaint you, that he will ſave you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if you will come unto him, be your ſins what they will, ſo you come not as righteous, but as ſinners to him; ſo you take his Righteouſneſs to cover you, and his Spirit of grace to unite you to him, and make you holy, and will give up your ſelves unto him: All which he will help, if you will come and cry to him; yea, if you cannot come, he will draw you: if you are unwilling, he will make you willing: if you have no heart, he will <hi>give you heart:</hi> What more? Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man or woman, that ſhall ſtand off one moment longer! Is not Hell too good for thee, if thou ſhalt now turn thy back upon ſuch grace? Let me have your Anſwers this day: Let me know that ſinner that will go home reſolved to be as <hi>careleſs</hi> as he formerly hath been, as well-opinioned of himſelf, as much reſolved againſt Holineſs, as thoughtleſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damned, if he with-ſtand the Lord in his Free-grace one day more? Oh! Will not your hearts ſtirre? dead, ſtupid ſoules! Shall God's Free-grace, his Chriſt, go a begging this day, and will not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come up to his terms? Old ſinners, that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the grave and Hell too, will not you accept of Free-grace, of Chriſt, the Spirit, this day? that are upon the brink of the grave and everlaſting burnings, and have many a thouſand ſin yet unpardoned? Is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170425:67"/>
all this nothing to you? but reſt in a blind hope of mercy, without coming to Jeſus Chriſt, without care of being made holy, and fit for Heaven: Oh you have been faſt aſleep in ſin, deceived by your own hearts, abuſed by the Devil fourty, fifty, ſixty years, Is't not time for you to bethink your ſelves, to go and cry to the Bleſſed God; Oh! grace, pardon, Chriſt, Heaven upon any terms! My righteouſneſs I have truſted in, are poor Cobwebs, my Confidences vain: Oh! for a drop of free-mercy and grace, from that Ocean that is in God, and 'twere better then all I have done for Heaven yet: Oh Lord! Now, now, I come to thee; Is there free-mercy and grace for one that hath ſleighted it? Yea, though thou haſt gone on froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy own heart, yet he can heal thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18.</p>
               <p>And you that are younger, 'tis a deſperate thing now in times of Goſpel-Light, when it glares upon your faces, to ſhut your eyes, to go on in the way of your own hearts, to ſleight Goſpel-grace, to harden your ſelves, and cry; Hereafter, hereafter. Alas! thou knoweſt not what ſhall be on the morrow; the Thread of thy Life is quickly cut with a ſtroke from God. Beſide, to go on long from year to year, againſt the loud and frequent Call of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt Convictions, that thou ſhouldeſt do otherwiſe, is the way to be given up to utter hardneſs, and the Lord to move upon thy heart no more. There's a day of grace to every Soul, which if he ſuffer to ſet and go down upon him, he is irrecoverably loſt for ever: Look to it, you younger men and maidens, that have yet no work upon you; that are the ſame you were, under the means you have lived; that have not the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170425:68"/>
Spirit of grace and mourning upon you, when others are praying and wraſtling with the Lord, and taking the Kingdom of Heaven by violence. Oh up, and be ſtirring, the day of grace hath ſhined long upon you; Hold out no longer, <hi>Come, come, come,</hi> you careleſs Sons and Daughters, and the way is open to you; the door of Free-grace is open, Chriſts Arms are open; you may be ſaved and bleſſed for ever, if you come in, now you are invited; I can take no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: <hi>Come,</hi> or ſay, I am reſolved for Hell, and to venture the utmoſt in the condition I am in: Oh bold and fearleſs Atheiſt! What ſhall I ſay to thee, if that be thy Reſolution? But I cannot be ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Say, you ſinners, as if I ſhould name you; Are you for Heaven, or Hell; for Free-grace, or your own patcht-up Righteouſneſs; for Carnal eaſe, or any Pains for Heaven; for your Luſts, or for Holineſs; for Jeſus Chriſt, or the Devil? Let thy Heart anſwer in good earneſt this day.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall I, at laſt, have this Anſwer: Hold! I am reſolved for the Free-grace of God; for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If all the ſinners in the Congregation, yea in the World, ſhould turn their backs upon him; The Word of the Lord hath overcome, Oh Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, may I come, ſuch a Wretch as I, come! Yea, ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come.</hi> Grace is as free as ever it was: Say then, Oh Lord, I come, draw me, and I will come: Into the Arms of Free-grace I throw my ſelf: my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is an abominable thing: Ah! a Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any tearms: Oh let, let me creep unto thy Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Feet; let me have the Loweſt-Room in thy Heart: Take what way thou wilt to purge me, ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170425:68"/>
I may but get well unto thee. Now Lord, as much Holineſs as thou wilt; let thy precious bloud waſh me all over. Well! go thus, and acquaint the Lord Jeſus with it from day to day: Wait, he will ſpeak to thee: love to hear more from him, and of him, in his Goſpel, and thou biddeſt fair for Heaven; yea, there will preſently be joy in Heaven for thee.</p>
               <p>In a word, I proteſt againſt you, in the Name and Authority of God, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt who hath ſent me, if you ſhall withſtand the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, freely, moſt freely offered you, I ſhall be a Witneſs againſt you; and if any ſinners in the World ſhall be certainly damned, you are they, who neglect this great Salvation: 'Tis come to this, I would, ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, and ye will not. What a do to have a ſinner that's ſinking to Hell, to come to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be freely ſaved? What ſhould a guilty ſinner do, but come to a free Saviour to be ſaved, and accept of his tearms (which are ſo bleſſed) with a thouſand hearts if he had them? Now ſay, how am I ſtraitned, till I get to him; I would go and weep my heart out to him, had I a heart to do it.</p>
               <p>Now I leave what hath been ſpoken to the good pleaſure of God, and the work of his Power, who is able to ſend away every Soul trembling, and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelvs to him.</p>
               <p>Onely a word to any poor humbled doubting ſoul, that thinks infinitely well of all this, but ſaith in his heart; All this grace is too good for me, I have ſinned againſt it, and ſleighted it; I fear, whether ever I may be accepted. Oh remember and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>Grace</hi> were not <hi>Grace,</hi> if 'twere no <hi>free:</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170425:69"/>
God <hi>can</hi> ſave a ſinner <hi>freely;</hi> that's enough to ſtay thee: yea, though thou haſt ſleighted grace, (as where is the Saint but did ſo? before effectually called,) yea God <hi>will</hi> ſave a ſinner freely, that will come by Jeſus Chriſt unto him. <hi>He will:</hi> What would'ſt have more? Do not ſtand reaſoning thus: but, If thou art a ſinner undone without him, caſt off from thy own Confidences; go to him, in the Name of God, and believe him upon his own word: ſay, I take thee, Bleſſed Lord, upon thy own word: Thou ſayeſt, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come:</hi> and, Lord, therefore I come: I durſt not come, were I not invited freely: and if I muſt be ſaved freely, if ever, then thou art to beſtow all, work all, begin and perfect all: Oh bleſſed Lord, I come unto thee for it; go and do thus, and thou ſhalt be comforted, and rejoyce in his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I might alſo here preſs bleſſed Souls, who have been drawn to Jeſus Chriſt, and overcome by Free-grace to do it, to live in the admiration of that grace, and to be low, and poor, and empty in your ſelves, in the abundant ſenſe of it all your days: Let your enjoyments and attainments be what they will, be it known unto you, that by grace ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and you had, and have as much need of it, as any ſinner in the World: God's Deſign, in ſaving you, was to glorifie Grace; and it muſt be your Deſign alſo here, and for ever.</p>
               <p>Having thus opened, in ſome meaſure, the grace of God to be the Fountain of a ſinner's Salvation, I ſhall now proceed to diſcover the way of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of this grace, which is by Jeſus Chriſt: (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170425:69"/>
that is in Jeſus Chriſt) though God reſolved to beſtow grace upon ſuch as ſhall be ſaved freely; yet in a way of his own moſt wiſe and bleſſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, by his Eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom this Diſpenſation of Grace was committed; which I ſhall further open in this Doctrine: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> All that Grace and Mercy which GOD gives out freely to ſinners, is conveyed to them by his Eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               <p>I might be abundant in the proof of this: See in that 5th of the <hi>Rom. v.</hi> 17.21. — <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteouſneſs ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And verſ. 21. <hi>That as ſinne hath reigned unto death, even ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life by Jeſus Christ our Lord:</hi> All the grace that ſhould reign unto Life is given out by one <hi>Jeſus Christ. The Law was given by</hi> Moſes; <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. All the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace were laid up in him; and therefore he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>All things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto me of my Father, and none can come unto the Father but by me;</hi> which he makes as the great Argument why ſinners ſhould come unto him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. Now ſo far as the Lord hath revealed the wiſe and holy Counſels of his heart in his Word unto us, let us inquire into the Reaſons why he took ſuch a way to give all his grace to the children of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The firſt is this, That as mankind loſt all in the Fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was a publique perſon, repreſenting all that came of him: ſo it was the wiſdome of God in the recovery of loſt-man to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170425:70"/>
bring forth another perſon that ſhould be fully ſtockt with grace and righteouſneſs, as a publique perſon to repreſent all the Elect unto the Father: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account Jeſus Chriſt is called the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And the Apoſtle ſets the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his offence unto Death, and the grace and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt, as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> one againſt the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, &amp;c. <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle ſets the Life, Grace, Righteouſneſſe, of Ieſus Chriſt, as the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> againſt the Death, Condemnation, Diſobedience of the firſt man that ſinned, in the 7 laſt Verſes of that Chapter. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Wiſdome of the Father is moſt excellently ſet forth, and the ground of Conſolation to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers laid upon a moſt ſure Foundation; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they loſt in the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> they recover with <hi>much more</hi> abundance in Ieſus Chriſt; for ſo the Apoſtle hath [that <hi>much more</hi>] in the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, three or four times; that Saints may ſee how abundantly compleat they are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. All grace is conveyed by Ieſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there needed a perſon to ſtand between GOD and Sinners, as a <hi>Mediatour</hi> to work forth Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation between them. Now who was meet but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to undertake this? He being the Eternal Son of God, equal with God, was near unto God. A mere Creature was infinitely unfit for ſuch an undertaking: And he being alſo the Son of man, cloathed in the nature of man; he thus partaking of the nature of God, who was to be appeaſed; and of the Nature of Man, who was to be reconciled, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170425:70"/>
a moſt meet Undertaker of ſo glorious a <hi>Work;</hi> Whence he hath that bleſſed Title given him of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour: Jeſus the Mediatour of a New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, the Man Christ Ieſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God reſolved, that his bleſſed Son Ieſus Chriſt ſhould have the <hi>honour</hi> in this bleſſed Tranſaction, to convey his grace to loſt Sinners, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son:</hi> So the Apoſtle fully, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>All things were for him;</hi> And, <hi>that in all things he might have the preheminence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For by him, and to him, and for him are all things.</hi> This honour the Father committed to the Son, to bring about this great Contrivance of bringing Man back again unto God.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

So loved it, that he could not give forth a greater manifeſtation of his love. Now the Father purpoſed to render his love to ſinners, by the gift of his Son, moſt full and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and therefore gave him out of his Boſome, and all the Riches of his Love and Grace by him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This way of the Father's diſpenſation of grace by his Son Ieſus Chriſt, hath rendered the grace of God moſt <hi>ſure and unchangeable</hi> to his own. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace being now eſtabliſht between the Father and Ieſus Chriſt; Ieſus Chriſt being the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker in it for all the Father gave him; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly founded upon a ſure Bottome: This was the Father's Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6.— <hi>I will give him for a

Covenant to the People.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, as a common perſon, did repreſent all the Elect in the Covenant, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Covenant, did repreſent all his; and Ieſus Chriſt did undertake to bring them to God, to bring them into the Covenant, and ſo to eſtate them in all the grace, and mercy, and bleſſing of it: Therefore the mercies of the Covenant are ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The ſure mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. As a Type of Ieſus Chriſt, coming of the Seed of <hi>David:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſet forth the excellency of the New Covenant, the whole Tranſaction of it intruſted in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore not one drop of the mercy of it, can ever fail thoſe that are taken into it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the giving forth of Jeſus Chriſt the whole of Goſpel-Salvation is rendered more glorious; The Wiſdome, Juſtice, Holineſs of God, as well as mercy and love do ſhine forth in Jeſus Chriſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel-myſtery is ſtyled, <hi>The manifold Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> Epheſ. 3.10. Every Attribute of God is glorified in the giving out of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea, had not God taken this way of making out himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, the World had dwelt in groſs darkneſs of him: Therefore Jeſus Chriſt is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Image of the Inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of the Father; The brightneſs of his glory,</hi> Heb. 1. And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The light of the knowledge of the glory of God,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to ſhine in the face of Jeſus Christ.</hi> The Creation is but a dark ſhadow of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>God,</hi> as to what is revealed of <hi>God</hi> in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There are the <hi>Footſteps</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Creatures; but his Character and Image in his Bleſſed Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. There could not have been acceſs to <hi>God,</hi> but by

                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; for through him, we both have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 1, 18. How could polluted Duſt draw nigh to the abſolute majeſty and glory of <hi>God,</hi> had not he let forth himſelf in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as in our own Nature, and ſo makes way for a poor ſinner to come before him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Had <hi>God</hi> let forth mercy to ſinners, and not given out his Son <hi>Jeſus Christ: His juſtice muſt have been violated,</hi> which is the main of all. The word of the Lord was abſolute; <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye, Gen.</hi> 2.17. which was meant of the Eternal Death of the Soul in its ſeparation from the life of <hi>God;</hi> as is clear in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. laſt. where grace unto eternal life by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is put in oppoſition to that death which was by ſin, which muſt therefore needs be meant of Eternal Death.

Now this Death muſt be executed upon all the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam,</hi> or elſe <hi>God</hi> muſt take ſome other way to ſatisfie his juſtice, he will ſave the ſinner; which was upon his own ſon Jeſus Chriſt; as will further be evidenced in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Bleſſed God</hi> took this way of letting out himſelf, his grace by Jeſus Chriſt, that thereby <hi>Saints might have union with him,</hi> which was a holy deſign of rhe Father in ſaving them; — <hi>That they may be one in us,</hi> Ioh. 17.21. The deepeſt and moſt unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able myſtery in our Salvation: Now Ieſus Chriſt, as the Eternal Son of <hi>God,</hi> taking upon him our natures, we became capable of being united to him, through the Spirit, and made one with the humane nature of Chriſt, whereby we are alſo united to the <hi>God-head,</hi> and ſo become one with the Father and the Son, which is the top of the Saints perfection.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Now what hath bin ſaid, as to the grounds and reaſons of God, in given out his eternall Son, and letting forth all grace by him, may ſerve to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with this rich and glorious Myſtery, as it is ſtyled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. Namely, <hi>God reconciling the word by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> letting forth the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: glorifying all his Attributes, making ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his glory, providing ſuch a way of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſuch a glorious Mediator, laying the bleſſed project of a ſinner's glorious ſalvation ſo ſure, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring his love ſo acceptable and glorious, making way for free acceſſe unto himſelf, and how we might become one with him; Oh! the depths of the wiſdome and love of God; which of them may we admire moſt? well may Angels pry into this holy Myſtery, well may it be the aſtoniſhment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, of the whole Creation; How much more of a ſinner, for whoſe ſake it was thus ordered! Oh: that we might fall upon our faces, and adore the wiſdom and grace of God, in ſuch a contrivance as this, Oh! unmeaſurable goodneſſe! unfathomed wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! Eternity is but enough to admire it! To behold God in Chriſt, will be the viſion which the ſouls of bleſſed Saints, will be wrapt up into, to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Oh! therefore what infinite mercy is it to be brought forth in new Teſtament-times, when the Myſtery, hid in God, hid from ages, <hi>kept ſecret ſince the word began,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.25. is brought to light, and ſparkling upon the darkneſſe of the world; when the glory of God is riſen upon the world: Now, If <hi>this Goſpel be hid, tis hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.

that yet ſit in darkneſſe and the ſhaddow of death, Ariſe, Awake, look up, that Goſpel-light may ſhine into you; Oh cry, &amp; wait that your eyes may be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to behold God coming forth, in the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in the glorious Goſpel, waite for the ſpirit, and thar the Goſpel in the preaching of it, may become <hi>the ministration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. Oh! guilty world, that ſo ſlight the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and contemn the Miniſtration of it; woe unto them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God doth let forth no grace and mercy but by Jeſus Chriſt; It may ſerve to <hi>unbottom poor ſouls</hi> from a generall carnall hope of mercy, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the way of grace by Jeſus Chriſt, nor coming as loſt ſinners in themſelves to be found in Chriſt, and juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt: this they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglect, having an empty notion of Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but know not for what? and upon what grounds, and how a ſinner gets to God by him, Oh! let this reprove you for this groſſe and damnable neglect, and convince you that all your pretended hopes of mercy will vaniſh, unleſs you learn the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore, If no way to the Father, no intereſt in mercy, no acceſſe to God but by Jeſus Chriſt; Let it ſerve to teach poor ignorant ſinners, yea all of us, how to get to God, to mercy, into his Covenant, Oh! No way but by Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! I can never come to the preſence of Gods Majeſty, but by Jeſus Chriſt, who is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mediator to bring a poor ſinner to himſelf, to make way for him into the preſence of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh mercy and grace to a poor ſinners, Oh, ſay, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170425:73"/>
I could acquaint my ſelf with Jeſus Chriſt, take hold of his skirts, and he will bring me into the favour, love, covenant, viſion, union of God; This is the <hi>way</hi> for a ſinner to come unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let it call upon Saints, that know Jeſus Chriſt in the Spirit, that they do not grow <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to him, that they <hi>neglect</hi> not Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him not in his bleſſed Mediation, grace, love, fellowſhip, appearance, ordinances; 'Tis a grievious thing, and very apt are Saints to it, to neglect Jeſus Chriſt; Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtill know and conſider, that as your acceſſe to God was by him at firſt, ſo it is ſtill; His Mediation for you, his love and grace and fellowſhip is as good as ever, as precious as it ever was; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have high and precious thoughts of him, of your bleſſed acceſſe to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I come to open is, how Jeſus Chriſt wrought forth ſalvation and juſtification for a ſinner, ſo that the free grace of God might by him be freely let out upon a ſinner, Namely, the work of his <hi>Redemption, [through the redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4.]</p>
               <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the many difficulties, that the wiſdome of the fleſh hath ſtarted about the <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>worke</hi> of our Redemption; but endeavour as I have promiſed to give it out, in a plain Scripturall practicall manner, for the uſe of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Redemption ſignifies a deliverance from captivity, by a price or ranſome laid down.</p>
               <p>Man had ſin'd himſelf into captivity, and a juſt condemnation; God from his own free mercy, was willing he ſhould be ſet at liberty; but this ſhould
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170425:73"/>
not be done but by a <hi>price</hi> or <hi>ranſome</hi> being paid to God, which was the intervening <hi>death</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, who being the eternal Son of God, came down from Heaven, took upon him the nature of man, was willing to ſtand in the room of ſinners, bearing their ſins in the undergoing the puniſhment for them, whereby God <hi>laid upon</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the iniquities of all,</hi> that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.6. proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as if he had bin the ſinner, in a way of Juſtice, executed his wrath upon him; Thus he is ſaid to dye <hi>for</hi> the ſins of his own, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. and to give himſelf <hi>for</hi> us, and to give his life a ranſome <hi>for</hi> many, which death of Jeſus Chriſt is ſtyled an <hi>expiatory ſacrifice, an atonement and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> All which do imply, that by the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> was made to the infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of God, as if the ſinners, that are ſaved by it, had ſuffered the utmoſt of divine Juſtice in their own perſons; Thus much may ſerve briefly, to open the nature of Chriſts redemption.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine I ſhall lay down from the words will be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> To the Salvation and Juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (in order to Gods letting out his free grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,) there was required the death of Jeſus Chriſt, as a price laid down, to the juſtice of God for his redemption.</p>
               <p>I might urge many more texts, beſides what have bin named, As 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.19.—<hi>redeemed, not with ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but with the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. Col. 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſſe of our ſins;</hi> This was it which was typified by all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170425:74"/>
the ſacrifices in the Old Teſtament-diſpenſation, as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> at large; ſpecially in the 9th <hi>Chapter, verſe</hi> 12.13, 14, 22. — <hi>And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things are by the law purged with blood, and without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence the reaſons of divine wiſdome, thus proceeding, ſo farre as revealed in the word, will be clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſons</hi> 1. That the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the ſalvation of ſinners, as well as <hi>mercy,</hi> Now there being <hi>atonement</hi> made to <hi>Juſtice</hi> by the <hi>death</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt the Righteouſneſſe of God hath a ſhare in the glory of mans ſalvation with the Grace and mercy of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holineſſe</hi> of <hi>Gods juſtice</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, which being violated, by the ſin of man, it was moſt equall that ſatisfaction be made, which no mere creature was able to do, and therefore the eternall Son of God, bleſſed for ever, was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Father to it: therefore 'tis ſaid <hi>verſe</hi> 25. of this 3d of the <hi>Rom.— That He might be juſt, and the justifier of them that believe in Ieſus,</hi> given as a reaſon of Gods ſetting forth his Son to be a <hi>propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The expreſſe word of the Lord did require it, who <hi>pronounced</hi> to all mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> that the tranſgreſſour ſhould <hi>ſurely dye, Gen.</hi> 2.17. Therefore upon his tranſgreſſion, the ſinner muſt either dye in his own perſon, or another in his ſtead, which God in his infinite wiſdome might order as he pleas'd; Now God being willing to glorifie his mercy, choſe to lay this puniſhment on his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, and not on the condemned ſinner, which Jeſus
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170425:74"/>
Chriſt alſo voluntarily undertaking, the word of the Lord was fully made good, and Jeſus Chriſt dying for the ſinner, (being made a curſe for him,) 'twas all one as if the ſinner himſelf had dyed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God gave out a holy and righteous Law, written in the heart of <hi>Adam;</hi> which Law was <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>good, Rom.</hi> 7. Now this Law being broken, God would not diſpence with it, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the ſinner, unleſſe his Law was <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt undertook; Rom. 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might fulfill'd in us,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 4.4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Law was fullfilled by Ieſus Chriſt, as if the ſinner had kept it fully in his own perſon, by Chriſt's becoming <hi>obedient</hi> to the death of the Croſſe, and ſo ſuffering the puniſhment of the Law; (ſtill in the ſtead and name in the ſinner) and by his keeping the Law, in the pure originall righteouſneſſe of his nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26, 27. and by his actuall obedience to it, in the <hi>perfect</hi> obſerving of it, Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many were made righteous;</hi> Namely, by the <hi>obedience</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, which he gave unto the Law; Now all ſinners being condemned by the Law, the Law could not remit them, till it was ſatisfied, it call'd for <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and <hi>full obedience,</hi> which Ieſus Chriſt gave unto it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:170425:75"/>5. God could not ſo <hi>freely</hi> (to ſpeak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men) let out grace and mercy, unleſſe ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction had bin given by Ieſus Chriſt: now it can come eaſily, delightfully, chearfully from the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and gracious God, ſeeing his juſtice will not plead againſt it, but for it, being bleſſedly ſatisfied, and Ieſus Chriſt by his death did fully <hi>merit</hi> it and <hi>deſerve</hi> it at the hands of God, and laid down as much as God in infinite juſtice would require, therefore tis now as well <hi>justice</hi> as <hi>mercy</hi> for God to remit a ſinner that comes to God by Ieſus Chriſt, 1 Iohn 1.7. <hi>God is juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, hereupon, God having <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> of ſuch a way of <hi>atonement,</hi> his juſtice glorified, and ſatisfied, his word (that the ſinner ſhould dye,) made good, his Law to the utmoſt ſatisfied; what remaines, but that the bleſſed God can remit the <hi>bondage, guilt, condemnation</hi> of the ſinner, having thus accepted of ſatisfaction? what remaines but that he ſhould pronounce, as he doth, Iob 33.24. <hi>Deliver him, for I have found a ranſome;</hi> God can now pardon the ſinner that comes believingly by Ieſus Chriſt to him for it, without any regreat, his juſtice ſhall be glorified by it, as well as his mercy; God hath charg'd all upon another, and accepted of full payment, call'd himſelf to witneſſe of it, and will never repent of it;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhould Object, Wherein is <hi>free grace</hi> glorified, if God have received full ſatisfaction to his juſtice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Twas infinite free grace for God to <hi>give</hi> out his bleſſed Son Ieſus Chriſt, when there was <hi>no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:170425:75"/>
upon him; he gave him and ſent him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. from his own free love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there's a world of free grace in mans ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Twas infinite grace towards the ſinner, <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſatisfaction by a Surety,</hi> Heb. 5. and not on the ſinner, the party offending, himſelf; what abundant grace, and love, to lay the ſins and guilt upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpecially the onely Son of his boſome, who was without all ſinne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the poor helpleſs ſinner for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Twas infinite free grace for <hi>God himſelf to contrive the way, of ſuch a Redemption:</hi> had it bin left to ſinfull man to have found out a way, how juſtice might be ſatisfied, he could never have done it; It could never have entred into the heart of Man or Angels, to have offered to God a ſatisfactory way for the making up of his wronged juſtice, but he muſt have periſhed for ever; therefore this is a world of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Father was at Liberty, to <hi>impute</hi> this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt to whom he would, to this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and not to another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>He will have mercy, on whom he will have mercy,</hi> &amp;c. So that 'tis indeed a <hi>debt</hi> to Chriſt; but all of free mercy and grace, to any Sinner that is ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If then Salvation &amp; remiſſion of ſins came in this way, by the death &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt, then it may diſcover to us the infinite hatred that God bears to ſin, that, to make expiation &amp; atonement to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, there could no ſacrifice be found, but the death of his eternall Son Ieſus Chriſt; Oh! that ever a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170425:76"/>
ſhould delight in that, which the holy God ſo much hates and abhorres?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be for convincement to poor ſinners <hi>of the infinite neceſſity</hi> of this way of <hi>Redemption</hi> by Ieſus Chriſt, in laying down his life to ſatisfie the juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> and of getting their part in it; you have heard the caſe of a ſinner, condemn'd by the Law, liable to eternall death, ſubject to the rigour of divine juſtice, no way able or in a Capacity to make ſatisfaction to <hi>God,</hi> mercy as it were bound up by juſtice, Oh! therefore what neceſſity of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, of a Redeemer, to work forth deliverance, to lay down a ranſome for ſinners, dye and undergo the curſe and wrath of the great and dreadfull <hi>God,</hi> full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, make ſatisfaction to the wronged ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>God</hi> to the utmoſt; this Ieſus Chriſt hath done for miſerable ſinners that will come to him. Now, the moſt of poor ſouls, have but a notion of Chriſts dying, but know not what is meant by <hi>Chriſt dying for me,</hi> though ſometimes in their mouths; Oh! ſinner for Chriſt to dye for thee, (if thou getteſt a part in his death) is to undergo the puniſhment and curſe and death that thy ſoul was liable to, which otherwiſe muſt have come upon thee to the utmoſt, it was to be made ſin and curſe for thee, to bear thy ſins, and ſtand in them; Oh! that thou couldſt really be convinced of <hi>the neceſſity of this Redemption,</hi> that thou couldſt never come to <hi>God</hi> without it, and therefore to get thy poor ſoul ſtated in it!</p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> juſtice can onely be by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, then let me again preſſe you, that you take heed of performing your duties and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170425:76"/>
repentings as if thereby you did <hi>ſatisfie</hi> and <hi>pacifie</hi> God for the ſin of your ſouls. This is the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſnare upon poor ſouls, that though they have ſinned, yet they hope God will be pacified with ſome praying, and ſorrowing, and amendement: now, though this ſhall be in a ſpirituall manner, upon every pardoned ſinner, and tis a capacity <hi>God</hi> puts the ſinner into, when he applyes the death of his Son, and ſo gives out mercy and pardon, yet you muſt moſt carefully take heed, that you offer not up ſuch duties, as if they did make <hi>God</hi> amends, and pacifie him for your ſins; but look above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, as if they were not, and ſo to caſt your eye to the great ſacrifice of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which <hi>Alone</hi> makes atonement to <hi>God,</hi> and makes way for a poor ſinner to come to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That as ſinners would learn the bleſſed Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Redemption, and the neceſſity of it, and how it makes atonement, merits mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, procures peace and reconciliation with <hi>God,</hi> ſo they would come and <hi>accept</hi> of it, and fall down before the righteous <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> it to him; Thou haſt heard the way of <hi>Gods</hi> letting out mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and no mercy but in that way, but by juſtice being ſatisfied by the death and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he becomes the Saviour of ſinners; Now this bloud is offered up to <hi>God,</hi> the price is paid and accepted with <hi>God,</hi> and in the Goſpel of <hi>God</hi> tis revealed and preacht to the guilty world, and tis <hi>freely offered</hi> to any poor ſinner, that will come and accept of it, and make claim to it, and plead for mercy and forgiveneſſe upon the account of it, and will come to the <hi>termes</hi> of it, which is to

be accepted and pardoned alone by vertue of it, to be waſhed and ſanctified, and actually deliver'd not onely from the guilt and condemnation of ſin, but the power and reign and pollution of it.</p>
               <p>Oh Sinner! be awakened and ſtirred up by the word of the Lord, to get actuall deliverance from the <hi>guilt, bondage, reign, ſervice,</hi> of thy ſin; go and cry to <hi>God,</hi> offer him up the blood of his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son, tell him thou ſeeſt he may let out juſtice upon thee to deſtroy thee, and damn thee for ever, of thy ſelf thou haſt no plea againſt it; But aske the bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> if it may not be more glory to him, and his grace &amp; mercy glorified by it, if he will accept of ſatisfaction by his own Son Jeſus Chriſt; plead to him, that thou heareſt he dyed in the room of guilty condemned ſinners, <hi>ſuch as thou art, ungodly, Rom.</hi> 5.6. yea tell him, with an humble adoration of his mercy and love in it, that thou heareſt in his bleſſed Goſpel, that 'tis offered to any ſinner that will come and accept it, and that 'tis proclaimed from heaven, that theres <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made by the blood of a Ieſus, for the greateſt ſinner, ſuch as thou art, Oh! cry unto him, that therefore thou comeſt and beggſt to be heard in thy plea, and that it may be entred in Heaven, that thou comeſt for all the ends of his death; thou art weary of the ſervice of thy luſts, and the pollution of thy nature, and therefore thou wouldſt have thy nature cleanſed, thy conſcience purged, all which thou findeſt the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt is able to do; yea tell him, and plead it with ſome humble boldneſſe, that thou art acquainted that Jeſus Chriſt prayes in Heaven, for ſuch ſinners that come and plead his bloud to thee, and that he

is heard in what he prayes, and that therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe muſt be had; yea, ſay, thou will hold on thy plea, thou haſt no other, and art reſolved againſt any other: If thou ſhalt to Hell pleading the bloud of a Saviour, be it ſo, but I am reſolved to plead it to the utmoſt; yea, tell him, &amp; cry to him that it cannot <hi>repent</hi> him, that he hath ordained the ſacrifice of the bloud of his own Son, and therefore why ſhouldſt thou be rejected? Yea, Come to this iſſue, through the Spirit of faith upon thee, that if it can be that a ſinner crying out for pardon, upon the account of the death and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and for ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may go to Hell; then thou wilt willingly lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and open it no more, but ſinke under divine vengeance to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Oh! That every poor ſinner might go home with this plea in his heart, written there by the holy Ghoſt; and pierce Heaven with his or her cryes and groanes, and put the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt before him, and plead for mercy and holineſſe, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſanctified, till God ſay, Go in peace, thou art pardoned, redeemed, and bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Yet a little to excite a poor drowſie ſinner to this eternall Concernment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, thou art under the guilt of thouſands of ſins; one whereof is enough to ſink thee to Hell: Guilt, if continued, is Hell begun, and wants nothing but the execution of vengeance upon thee: Oh what ſhould a guilty ſinner do but cloſe with a Saviour, and get an intereſt in Redemption from it!</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:170425:78"/>2. Specially conſidering, that all the Duties and Obedience thou haſt performed towards God, or ever ſhall, have not made, (nor ever will) the leaſt payment to <hi>God</hi> for thy ſins, thou art as much in debt to <hi>God</hi> as ever thou waſt, as much behind with him: All the <hi>Items</hi> for the ſin of thy Nature, thy Thoughts, Words, and Actual Wickedneſs, and thy ſinful Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, ſtand uncancelled, all ready to be charged upon thee: And nought will be accepted for payment, but the death of Jeſus Chriſt, the onely Price that God will hearken to: Nothing will cancel the <hi>Book</hi> where all thy ſins are recorded: Nothing will <hi>blot out the Hand-writing</hi> that is againſt thee, but the <hi>blood</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is reſolved never to <hi>forgive</hi> you the Debt, till you have put in this Plea, and it be recorded in Heaven, and you have it in a Goſpel-way: No for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, but by <hi>Redemption pleaded, claimed, poſſeſſed,</hi> and <hi>ſealed by the Holy Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 1.7, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou art yet under the <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Reign</hi> of thy ſin, and therefore under condemnation; the Law is gone out againſt thee, thy Sentence pronounced; <hi>Curſed is every one that tranſgreſſeth,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Law: And thou art in bondage yet, and haſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured actual deliverance from it. If a Priſoner be condemned, and lye in Fetters in a Dungeon, and hears of a Ranſome paid for him, What's this to him, till he have his liberty.

               <p n="5">5. Conſider, as thou ſtandeſt in thy filth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of thy ſins, thou art unfit for God, either to pleaſe him in any thing thou doeſt, or to be with him in Heaven hereafter; thy perſon and ſervices are loathſome to the Soul of God; therefore get waſhed and purified in the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: Go on to cry, and wait (and beg a heart to do it, and that in Faith) till thou ſhalt feel peace coming in, by thy conſtant Plea of the bloud of Chriſt, till thou ſhalt feel <hi>cleanſing</hi> vertue of it upon thy Soul, till thou ſhalt experience the power of his death deſtroying ſin in thee, and ſo ſhalt finde, thou haſt fellowſhip with him, and ſo a part in this bleſſed <hi>Redemption</hi> we have been treating of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now to encourage a poor ſinner to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, with the Plea of Chriſt's bloud in his heart and mouth, and to draw forth the Faith of a poor humbled doubting ſoul.</p>
               <p>Conſider the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of the price of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and <hi>procure</hi> pardon and ſanctification for a poor ſinner; which may appear from ſuch like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Apoſtle in the 7th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> having been opening the excellency of Chriſt's Prieſthood, which is chiefly converſant in this Work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in the offering up of himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>v.</hi> 25. of that Chapter. <hi>Wherefore he is able to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170425:79"/>
ſave them to the utmoſt, that come unto God by him:</hi> To the utmoſt; that is, with a perfect Salvation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can be deſired to it. So in the 9th Chap. v. 11. &amp;c. the Apoſtle reaſoning from the Levitical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to this of the bloud of Chriſt, argueth the full perfection of it. — <hi>By his own blood he entred in once into the holy place,</hi> (namely, into Heaven) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained eternall Redemption for us;</hi> and thence concludeth, verſe 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Christ purge the conſcience,</hi> &amp;c? A <hi>much more</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, above all the Sacrifices that were offered up to God: Which will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the eternall God-head of Chriſts perſon, by which he offer'd up his bloud unto his Father; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. — <hi>Who through the eternall Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi> Which put an infinite value and efficacy upon the offering of his bloud; Inaſmuch as Jeſus Chriſt was God as well as Man, though he could onely dye in his humane nature, yet the efficacy of his God-head had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the price of his dying, which put an infinite worth upon it, and ſo renders it full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect redemption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The price of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, did not onely give a bare ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, but it had an infinite <hi>merit</hi> in it, <hi>a redundancy of merit,</hi> whereby it deſerved at the hands of God, that ſinners that are intereſſed in it, ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, grace, the love of God, and glory to come, ſpirituall bleſſings which the death of Chriſt <hi>purchaſed</hi> for the elect; which being alſo by the free purpoſe and Compact of God, there muſt neceſſarily ariſe an infinite <hi>merit</hi> in it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170425:79"/>3. The all-ſufficiency of the price of Chriſts blood is evidenced by his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> &amp; aſcenſion into glory, implying that he wrought forth full and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by his death, therefore he is ſaid <hi>to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for our juſtification, Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> and to be <hi>juſtified in the Spirit,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. laſt. that is, God by raiſing him from the dead, juſtified him in the atonement he had made by his death, and that he did chearfully accept of ſatisfaction by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The blood of Chriſt procures <hi>boldneſſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God,</hi> therefore there is an infinite worth in the price of it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Having therefore, Bretheren, boldneſſe to enter into the Holieſt, by the blood of Jeſus;</hi> which <hi>boldneſſe</hi> doth ariſe from the full ſatisfaction that is made to Divine juſtice, in as much as God, upon the acceptance of it, hath nothing to charge upon the ſinner himſelf, no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt him, having charged his ſins upon Chriſt, and therefore the poor ſinner may come with an humble boldneſſe into the preſence of God; and this is that which puts boldneſſe into the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a believer, when he appears before God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the experience of it, the fouleſt ſinners that have come unto it, have bin waſhed from their ſins by it, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Idolaters, Adulterers, Sodomites Drunkards, Revilers, have bin waſhed, and juſtified and ſanctified by it. <hi>The blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It cleanſeth and perfects them <hi>for ever:</hi> therefore call'd <hi>eternall redemption; once for all, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 10, 10, 19. <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170425:80"/>
them that are ſanctified;</hi> once juſtified and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Now from this <hi>ſatisfaction, merit, all-ſufficiency</hi> of the ſacrifice of the blood of Jeſus, to cleanſe a ſinner, to commend him to God, how ſafely may a ſinner <hi>venture</hi> his ſoul upon it, (which is the firſt act of faith)? A poor ſinner when under conviction, and the terrour of the Lord hath taken hold of him, lyes trembling before the Lord; whether God will let out <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> upon him; he is ready to give glory to the Juſtice of the Lord, if he reject him for ever. But now if a poor ſoul get a ſight of the blood of Chriſt, how it deales with the juſtice of God, what full and all-ſufficient ſatisfaction it hath made to God, for the ſins of ſuch as plead it to him, how God more delights in it, then in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſinner, what a ſtay is this to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering doubtfull Spirit of a poor ſinner? when he can come to ſee juſtice to have its due, and ſo God can freely let out remiſſion to a poor ſoul, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Act of a poor ſinners cloſing with it, though not preſently evidenced in his conſcience; Oh, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>venture</hi> the iſſue of all upon this price of the blood of Jeſus, thou mayſt ſee thou haſt the greateſt reaſon in the world to do ſo, thou wilt never come to have a ſafe bottome for thy ſoul, till thou comeſt thus to deal with the juſtice of God, as fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt ſtill be off and on about free mercy, till thou come to fix here, and be in ſome good meaſure eſtabliſht in it; Be daily in exerciſing thy ſoul in ſuch ventures and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it; and the ſpirit will at laſt witneſſe peace and reconciliation to thy conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:170425:80"/>In a word, ſinners, you that have had no ſtay to your ſpirits for the forgiveneſſe of your ſins, but a blind hope of mercy, look up, look up to the Juſtice of God, and ſee this way of acceſſe to God for you, by the blood of Jeſus; Oh! let not any profane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner trample it under foot, caſt it back upon the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed face of God, Say not in thy heart, let God take the blood of his Son to himſelf, Ile not be waſhed from my ſins, Ile not be ſanctified, Ile reſt as I am; Deſperate ſinner, Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhalt thou be thought worthy, then any ſinner under Heaven, who rejecteſt the <hi>onely worthy</hi> price of a ſinners ſalvation?

Come thou deſpiſer and caſt thy ſoul under the droppings of this blood, and it ſhall cleanſe thee, though thy ſoul were as black as Hell; <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>And thou poor formal out-ſide Profeſſour, who never didſt feel the <hi>vertue, healing, life,</hi> and <hi>warmth</hi> of the bloud of Chriſt upon thy heart: Oh reſt not in good thoughts of it onely, but come believingly to it, as thou haſt been exhorted: Say, and that with thy heart, Now Lord I would know the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this <hi>Redemption</hi> upon my poor ſoul: Waſh me, Lord, waſh me; I renounce all but the blood of this Chriſt, as to making way to God for me, Oh! let <hi>it pacifie</hi> my conſcience, and <hi>purge</hi> my conſcience, and I ſhall be clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:170425:81"/>If the Spirit of the Lord ſhall work thy heart to come as a guilty helpleſſe unholy ſinner in thy ſelf, to this blood of Jeſus, and make thy approaches to God daily, and argue for grace and remiſſion upon it, and purging thy ſoul; theſe ineſtimable bleſſings will be the iſſue of it, which I will but name to thee.</p>

               <p>Now if eaſe in thy ſin and the world, can do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, than this that I have named; then keep in; but if not, (as moſt certainly it cannot) Ariſe,

and come, to this bleſſed Redemption, and get thy part and portion in it; and thou ſhalt ſay, Bleſſed be thy counſell and advice for evermore.</p>
               <p>But now upon this Redemption of Ieſus Chriſt, how is a ſinner ſaid to be <hi>juſtified;</hi> that is, to be put into an <hi>actuall poſſeſſion,</hi> of the Redemption of Ieſus Chriſt through the free grace of <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Compact was made between <hi>God</hi> the Father and Ieſus Chriſt, as to the ſalvation of thoſe, that the Father gave to Ieſus Chriſt, and Ieſus Chriſt undertook the fulfilling of the Condition of the Covenant, ☞ <hi>God</hi> did <hi>purpoſe</hi> in himſelf to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them from eternity, and look't upon them as in Chriſt; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. So they were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified as to the purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Ieſus Chriſt performed the condition of obedience in his dying, and paid unto <hi>God</hi> what he required at his hands, for the ſinners redemption, then did <hi>God,</hi> as in the Court of Heaven, diſcharge the ſinner, (though not in the court of Conſcience) and when Chriſt aroſe and came to Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave him in, an abſolution of them all, from the guilt of ſin, and obligation to death; and ſo at the death of Chriſt all the Elect were <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, inaſmuch as the price was paid and accepted of the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When according to the purpoſe of <hi>God,</hi> through the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, a ſinner is <hi>called</hi> by grace, hath <hi>faith</hi> given him, (as purchaſed alſo for him) to embrace Ieſus Chriſt in the Promiſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as offer'd in the Goſpell, and with him all ſpirituall bleſſings; then is the ſoul put into the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170425:82"/>
                  <hi>actuall poſſeſſion</hi> of what God, in his purpoſe and love, determined to give him, and Ieſus Chriſt by the purchaſe of his blood, gave him a <hi>right</hi> to before, and ſo there is an <hi>Act</hi> of Gods pardoning mercy paſſeth upon the ſinner, he hath an actuall diſcharge given in unto his Conſcience, hath the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt <hi>imputed</hi> to him, and ſo is lookt upon by God not as a ſinner under guilt, but as righteous in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which beſpeakes him <hi>Juſtified,</hi> that is, made juſt and righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by the <hi>imputation</hi> and making over Chriſts righteouſneſſe to him, as if righteous in his own perſon; upon which Act of God there is a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinne, as in the Text, and the believer is put into another ſtate, a ſtate of juſtification unto life through Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was in a ſtate of death and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Before I ſpeak of that faith which, through grace, puts a ſoul in his pardoned and juſtified ſtate, I will breifly apply this to the Capacity of the weak.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may <hi>informe</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> you in this great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that any ſinner that is ſaved muſt be thus <hi>juſtified,</hi> made righteous, by the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt; he muſt come to ſee the juſtice of God made up, his ſin ſatisfied for a price paid unto God, and this to be actually made over to him: as we ſhall preſently ſhew; Moſt of ſinners, 'tis to be feared, do not conſider this, that ſpeak of mercy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they hope in mercy, but are never convinc'd of the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and what it is to paſſe from a ſtate of guilt to a ſtate of righteouſneſſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170425:82"/>
by Ieſus Chriſt, from a ſtate of condemnation, to a ſtate of juſtification; without which, there can be no ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Oh be convinced, ſinners, of this great matter, of the neceſſity of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in fulfilling the Law to be made over to you, to be brought into a juſtified ſtate, or you can never have pardon of ſin, and be accepted with God: you can never ſtand before God, but in the righteouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt. Say, If I do not get the righteouſneſs of Chriſt made mine: If I do not get thus juſtified, I muſt never expect pardon of my ſin, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my poor ſoul at the great day of the Lord. This is the Work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be ſavingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of this, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.8. Oh look up to the Father for the Spirit thus to convince you not onely of ſinne, and the damnableneſs and ſinfulneſs thereof, but of your infinite need to get, not onely ſome general hope of mercy and pardon, but the righteouſneſs of the Son of God, to bring you into a ſtate of pardon, reconciliation, peace, with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may further clear unto you, that your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God is not <hi>within</hi> you, but <hi>without</hi> you, wrought forth by Ieſus Chriſt, for ſuch as are, or ſhall be called by grace, and <hi>imputed</hi> to them, not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,</hi> or wrought in them: 'Tis not grace in you, that doth or can juſtifie you, though renewing grace ſhall be wrought in all that are ſo pardoned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Therefore, though thou muſt be changed in thy ſelf, pray and be holy, and obey God in all things; yet canſt thou not be hereby juſtified, but ſtill thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying righteouſneſs is in Chriſt, and not in thy ſelf, as the onely procuring-meritorious cauſe of pardon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170425:83"/>
and peace with God, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great queſtion therefore that ſhould come upon thy heart, is, Whether thou art in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or juſtification. If not juſtified; thou art ſtill, as I have ſhewed, under the condemnation of the whole Law: nothing thou haſt yet done, or ſhalt ever be able to do, will ſtand between Wrath and Hell; and thy poor ſoul, till thou comeſt to be juſtified in the bloud and righteouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt: Oh ſinners! ponder of this great thing that is now laid before you? Can you ſay from a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony within you? Oh! I <hi>was</hi> thus and thus, once under the reign, power, guilt, condemnation of ſin; but now, now (bleſſed be rich and free grace) I am <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, juſtified,</hi> in the Name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: See that Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of our Lord Ieſus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, at leaſt, that I may ſpeak to poor weak willing trembling ſoules: Is this it that your ſoules are reſtleſs after? Oh that I were, that I were, in ſuch a bleſſed ſtate! Oh that I could but believingly ſay, the righteouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt were mine, and that now I am, I am juſtified; Oh what peace, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and joy would fill my heart? Why Soul! If this be indeed the breathing of thy Soul, Ieſus Chriſt is thine, and thou art juſtified and pardoned, and <hi>God</hi> will at laſt give in unto thee (if thou continue to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him) the ſenſe and comfort of it in thy poor Soul: Onely by the way take a Diſcovery or two of the <hi>reality</hi> of thy Heart in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170425:83"/>1. If thy Soul, from a Spiritual Conviction, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a real making out after juſtification by Ieſus Chriſt, then thou would'ſt alſo be as <hi>really</hi> ſanctified, be made holy. 'Twas as much in the purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> to call thee out of a ſtate of ſinne, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee, as to pardon and juſtifie thee, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou art brought into a juſtified ſtate, thy ſoul making out after it, thou art made alive in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Thou art in Ieſus Chriſt, and wouldſt walk no more after the fleſh and the luſts thereof, but after the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>If ye are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye are not under the Law;</hi> namely, to condemn you, but are freed from the curſe of it: and <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no Law;</hi> that is, ſuch as would walk after the Spirit, be led by the Spirit, and ſhew forth the fruit of the Spirit: And this is that which the Apoſtle intimateth, 1 Ep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> namely, of the Spirit: So that every juſtified perſon hath the Spirit of Chriſt (according to the meaſure of the grace of God) dwelling in him, is quickned in the Spirit, being once dead, prays in the Spirit, mortifies ſin through the Spirit, is taught by the Spirit, and ſo in all other ſaving and ſanctifying vertues of it: If it be not thus with thee, thou, as yet, haſt no part in this bleſſedneſs, but art under condemnation unto death. And therefore, ſinner, come before God in the ſenſe of thy condemned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and give up thy ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, juſtified, ſanctified; and then bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:170425:84"/>3. Let called and ſanctified Believers labour to live in the ſenſe of a pardoned-juſtified ſtate, that God is not <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on</hi> with them, in the matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, though it may be ſometimes darkned and clouded, as to the evidence of it. Oh! do you labour to preſerve the ſenſe, and ſweet and bleſſed peace of it in your ſouls, &amp; give glory to the riches of grace; for, now there is <hi>No, No,</hi> condemnation to you; you are paſſed from Death to Life, and the Bleſſed God imputes no ſin unto you: Let this be the higheſt and ſtrongeſt Argument to Holineſs, and love to the glory that poſſibly may be; and if indeed you walk in the comfort of it, it will be ſo unto you.</p>
               <p>Onely let me give caution here to young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, whoſe hearts, at the firſt diſcovery of the free and glorious grace of the Goſpel, and of Ieſus Chriſt, are wonderfully taken and affected with it; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a time, are apt to want on with it, (unleſs the firſt humiliation be the deeper) and to wax ſleight in Duties, and ſo their Luſts recover ſtrength again, and return upon them; and either they fall, or are near unto it, to the freſh wounding of their Soules. This hath been the condition of many; therefore be well caution'd in it, and walk with fear in the midſt of your joyous apprehenſions of the ſweetneſs of grace, and the endearing love of the Lord Ieſus to you.</p>
               <p>Having briefly ſhewed what the nature of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, what it is to be in a juſtifyed ſtate before God, I now come to open more particularly how a Soul comes to be partaker of this juſtification, through the redemption of Ieſus Chriſt; namely, <hi>Through Faith in his bloud,</hi> ver. 25. of this 3d of <hi>Rom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:170425:84"/>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> As God, through Free-grace, hath ſet forth Ieſus Chriſt to work forth Redemption for ſinners; ſo there muſt be a ſpecial believing on, and applying the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, by every one that is ſaved.</p>
               <p>Therefore juſtification is attributed to Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. &amp; 3.11. In all which places, Faith is put in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Works of the Law. And ſo the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is called the <hi>righteouſneſs of Faith, Rom.</hi> 9.30. &amp; 10.6. in oppoſition to righteouſneſſe by Works: Not as if Faith were the matter of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, that it did, as an Act or Work in the Soul, juſtifie before God; but that God doth thus make over the bloud and righteouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt to a Soul, by inabling the Soul to come unto, to take hold of, to apply to it ſelf, to appropriate the merit of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt for its own Redemption and Salvation, which may afford us a plain Deſcription of <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> preciſely conſidered; namely,</p>
               <p>Faith is a work of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Soul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling it to appropriate, or apply to it ſelf the bloud and righteouſneſs of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſin, and its juſtification unto eternal life.</p>
               <p>So it is called, the <hi>work of Faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. and 'tis expreſſed by <hi>receiving</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and <hi>believing</hi> on his Name, <hi>coming</hi> unto him, <hi>resting</hi> upon him: So that, plainly, Faith is a going out to, believing in, truſting on another; namely, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for what it can never be able to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170425:85"/>
find or bring about in or by it ſelf; which may lead us to the more particular way of the Holy Ghoſt's working this power in the ſoul, in the ſaved ones of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the working of Faith in the ſoul, it is firſt brought to ſee an impoſſibility of coming to God, as <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> or <hi>by its ſelf,</hi> concluded under an utter una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to pacifie God, or make up a righreouſneſs in it ſelf, to get acceſs with God. The ſoul is emptyed from veſſell to veſſell, till all the things that it counted gain before, become loſſe for Jeſus Chriſt; This is the firſt work of the Spirit, it emptyes a poor ſinfull Creature of all its refuges, all its dependencyes, all its ſufficiencyes, and ſo becomes naked in its guilt before God, and therefore is brought to this, that its acceptance to God, (if ever it be accepted), muſt be out of its ſelf; what ever become of him, he muſt periſh as in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the work of ſaith, The ſoul is brought to ſee that this was the end of the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, of Gods <hi>ſetting him forth</hi> to be a <hi>propitiation,</hi> that he might work forth Redemption and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for ſome, that this is a way of Gods own ordaining, Jeſus Chriſt was ſet forth for this very end, even by God himſelf, and therefore the ſoul is brought to this concluſion, to venture the iſſue of its life, and eternall ſalvation upon it; and ſo throwes it ſelf, as in a ſinking condition, upon the the grace, blood, righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, ſink or ſwim, live or periſh, ſaved or damned, there the ſoul caſts Anchor, there it pitcheth, to this it will ſtand or fall before the righteous God; If there be not enough in the blood of Jeſus, to give it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170425:85"/>
with God, the ſoul reſolves, to Hell it muſt and will; There, ſaith a poor ſelf-emptyed ſoul, I caſt even away my ſelf (if it might be) upon it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoul is brought on to <hi>believe the report,</hi> that God in his word makes concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and of the <hi>price, value, merit,</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficiency</hi> of his blood to ſave a poor ſinner, even to the utmoſt, that comes to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. to anſwer all the wants and diſtreſſes of a poor ſoul, namely, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Juſtice of God, fulfilling the Law, making atonement, removing guilt, procuring remiſſion of ſins, reconciling to God, Rom. 5.9, 10. <hi>Much more being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him; For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life;</hi> In all which things, the ſoul is enabled to believe the <hi>report</hi> of the Goſpell, that the blood and death of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>can</hi> do all this for poor ſinners that ſhall pitch upon it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In this working of faith, the ſoul comes to ſee and faſten upon an abſolute unlimited <hi>Free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> where <hi>any</hi> ſinner, that <hi>will,</hi> may come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſo have the vertue, of his death and blood applyed to it; and therefore that he as well as any other ſinner in the world may come to him, and make claime to his blood, and plead it before God; <hi>whoſoever will, let him come; Rev.</hi> 22. Now ſaith a poor ſelf-emptyed ſinner, I do not find that I am any where excluded, but invited and called upon, to come to the Lord Jeſus, and claime an intereſt in his blood, and that I may plead it even at the throne of his juſtice, and that I may warrantably,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170425:86"/>
ſafely, upon good grounds, given out from the mouth of God himſelf, take hold of the Lord Jeſus in ſuch a promiſe, and there is no ſin, or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe can exclude me, unleſſe I will frowardly and wretchedly exclude my ſelf; I do not find, ſaith a poor ſoul, that any ſin is too great for the ſacrifice of that blood of Jeſus, ſo the ſinner will come to it, yea, that 'tis the greateſt ſin, and the top of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation, not to come to it; that I more injure God, by ſtanding off from Jeſus Chriſt, then by all the filthineſſe, blaſphemies, ungodlineſſes, my ſoul ever wallowed in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The blood of Chriſt is a price ſufficient for the ſins of the whole world, therefore, ſaith a poor ſoul, For mine; He is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world, therefore he can take away mine; and I am freely call'd and invited to it, and tis my rebellion not to come, what can I have more? And ſo ſenſe of peace and reconciliation falls in upon the Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſoul by its often renewing of ſuch Acts of believing, comes at laſt to ſee the blood of Jeſus Chriſt appropriated to him; now it can <hi>ſtay</hi> it ſelf upon the word of promiſe; and can ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in believing. If I rolle my ſelf upon the blood of Jeſus, I have the word of God for it, that I <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſaved; <hi>we ſhall be ſaved from</hi> wrath through him; not, it <hi>may</hi> be, but, we <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſaved, and all upon the account of being juſtified by his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. which juſtification ariſeth upon this believing we have mention'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:170425:86"/>Thus have I opened the nature of faith, as it is <hi>preciſely</hi> juſtifying, as it applyes and appropriates the blood and righteouſneſſe of the Lord Jeſus, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and Juſtification unto eternall Life; I might inſiſt upon the diſcovery of the effectuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of faith in the ſoul; as may diſtinguiſh it from a mere belief of the Hiſtory of the death of Jeſus Chriſt; take two or three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the ſoul, by faith, doth act upon the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for juſtification, it doth alſo bring the power and efficacy of it, for the purging of the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Christ, who through the eternall Spirit, offer'd himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the Living God;</hi> So Act. 15.9. <hi>Purifying your hearts by faith.</hi> There is a purifying vertue in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, upon the ſouls of believers; They are for the <hi>purging</hi> away the <hi>filth,</hi> as well as the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin; There's no believing ſoul but cryes out, Purge me, Oh Lord, purge me, and thoroughly, from my filth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoul hath a ſecret, yet reall fellowſhip, with the death of Jeſus Chriſt, to crucifie and deſtroy the body of ſin, in a juſtified believer which ariſeth from its union with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>For if we have bin planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the likeneſſe of his Reſurrection; knowing that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might, be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true believer can really ſay, <hi>I am,</hi> or I, would be, <hi>Crucified with Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 2.20. Which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there brings in, as an effect of Juſtification by faith.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:170425:87"/>3. Every juſtified believer looks upon this, as one great end of his Juſtification, <hi>that he might live to God,</hi> Gal. 2.19.— <hi>That I might live unto God; Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead indeed unto him, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.11. Every juſtified believer doth thus reckon of himſelf, I am to be dead to ſin, but alive to God, I am to yeild my ſelf to God, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. To have my fruit unto <hi>holineſſe, verſe</hi> 22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith that juſtifies, doth, through the Spirit, work the ſoul to <hi>Goſpel-obedience,</hi> to all the Lawes and Ordinances of Jeſus of Chriſt, which ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be the will Chriſt; from the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, and from a principle of love to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>John</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Juſtified believer will <hi>deny himſelf for Chriſt,</hi> take up his croſſe and follow Him: let any ſufferings be propoſed to a called believer, and let him know it is for Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſoul (unleſſe under a temporary deſertion or temptation) will chooſe and embrace thoſe ſufferings, and undergo them with ſome chearfulneſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Every juſtified believer, hath a <hi>marriage-union with Jeſus Christ, Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 32. The ſoul hath choſen Jeſus Chriſt, having broken off from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovers, hath betrothed it ſelf unto Chriſt, in an everlaſting bond and Covenant, hath given it ſelf to Chriſt; As Jeſus Chriſt beſtowes himſelf and all he hath upon the ſoul, ſo doth the ſoul beſtow it ſelf, and all it hath upon Jeſus Chriſt, and having ſo done reſolves to be contented with him in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and none in earth in Compariſon of thee,</hi> ſaith every gracious Believer.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:170425:87"/>7. Every juſtified believer <hi>lives by his faith, Gal.</hi> 2.20. lives upon Jeſus Chriſt for all, and fetcheth all from him, ſees him as a treaſury of all grace, hath recourſe unto him, this being the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Act of Faith, to make the ſoul live out of its ſelf, upon another, namely, Jeſus Chriſt for all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Faith, that entitles the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>works by love</hi> to all Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. When the Soul cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt, it will alſo cloſe with his Diſciples, as diſtinguiſht from carnal, unſavoury, dead Profeſſors. What makes the living among the dead? A living Soul, alive in Chriſt, highly priſeth fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſuch as are alive.</p>
               <p>I might name many more particulars; but theſe may ſuffice, as the moſt diſtinguiſhing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let what hath been ſpoken, ſerve to diſcover to you, Whether you have a Faith that doth entitle you to the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and the forgiveneſs of your ſins. Can you ſay, your Soules are carryed out after more purging, and 'tis your daily cry to Heaven? Can you ſay, that you are often crucifying with Jeſus Chriſt? And oh that I were, that I were but crucified with Jeſus Chriſt, that I might reckon of my ſelf as dead to ſinne! And oh that I might live to God, and might walk in Goſpel-obedience! That I might throughly deny my ſelf for Jeſus Chriſt, and chooſe to ſuffer with him, and for him. Oh I would more clearly ſee the Marriage-union between Chriſt and my poor Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would, I do, beſtow my ſelf upon him, and all that's mine; I do give my ſelf to him; I will be contented with him here, and for ever: Whom have I, whom have I, but him?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170425:88"/>
Oh have you found, in ſome good degree, ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of heart towards Jeſus Chriſt! And do you live by your Faith, upon Chriſt, upon Promiſes? and do you maintain your Souls this way: And do you love, and delight in, the Fellowſhip of living ſoules, ſavoury ſoules; or do you, at leaſt, long that you may have opportunity to do ſo? If you cannot, in ſome meaſure, experience theſe things, your Faith is a dead empty Speculation; ſuch a Faith that is ſo far from uniting you to Chriſt, that indeed it keeps you on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore ſay of it, 'tis a Faith that <hi>is in vain,</hi> that keeps me dead in my ſins: Oh therefore, ſay in thy Heart, I will now wait on the Word, the Miniſtration of it, that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to beget Faith; I will go and pray the Father to draw me to Jeſus Chriſt, and that my ſoul may be united to him, that I may have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his Death and Reſurrection; that I may be made alive unto God, that I may feel the pacifying-purging vertue of the bloud of the Lord Jeſus upon my poor Soul.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, Believers may try their Faith; and if they find their Soules to have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced theſe things, they may take comfort that they are juſtifyed by Faith in the bloud of Jeſus, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſaved by his Life.</p>
               <p>To wind up all in a word of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>If God hath <hi>ſet forth</hi> Ieſus Chriſt to be a <hi>propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that through <hi>Faith, in his bloud,</hi> a ſinner may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>justified</hi> from his ſinne, then what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here for ſinners to come to him, and believe on his Name, to venture the iſſue of Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him, ſince God himſelf hath <hi>ſet him forth.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170425:88"/>
For that end and purpoſe, that ſinners might come unto him, and be waſhed, juſtified, ſaved from their ſins. 'Tis not then to be doubted, but that God as he hath therein taken care for the Salvation of the ſinner, ſo for the glory of his own righteouſneſs: ſo that the ſinner hath no reaſon to doubt, that comes to Jeſus in the way propoſed; but that God can take pleaſure to accept of him through the bloud of Jeſus. 'Twas the moſt <hi>deliberate</hi> Act that ever the Wiſdom of God was taken up about, the <hi>ſetting forth</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, to be the Saviour of ſinners through his bloud: 'Twas the firſt Foundation that God ſaid from all Eternity; and after he had promiſed Jeſus Chriſt, it was ſome thouſands of years before he ſet him forth to the World: and therefore God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent nor change his mind, &amp; purpoſe, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, pardoning, juſtifying, ſanctifying poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that caſt their ſouls upon it, by the bloud of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Upon which it is, that bleſſed Souls are brought in, in the Scriptures, magnifying the grace of God for their cleanſing by the bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne:</hi> So are the Saints brought forth <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us to God by thy bloud:</hi> And Chap. 7.14. <hi>Theſe are they who have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb.</hi> Therefore, I ſay, with what boldneſs may poor ſinners come unto it? and how certainly, are they in Gods way to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? in which way, bleſſed ſouls have been ever found, and none did ever miſs of this end, the Salvation of their Soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:170425:89"/>I have now diſpatcht what I ſhall ſpeak at this time, as to the Doctrine of Juſtification, by the Free-grace of God, through the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and of Saving-Faith therein, and ſhall commit it to the Lord to work it upon the Conſcience; I ſhall a little inſiſt upon the laſt verſe, in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of that Objection, which the Heart puts up, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this bleſſed Truth.</p>

               <p>THE former Verſes intermitted, might have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us much choiſe matter, in the opening the Doctrine of Grace, and the Righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; namely, that God is juſt in the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Believer, upon Faith in the bloud of Jeſus, from <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And that the Doctrine of Grace excludes all boaſting from the Creature, from <hi>v.</hi> 27. That Jew and Gentile, all that are ſaved, muſt come to God, and be juſtified in this way, and no other, from <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. But I muſt contract my ſelf. I come now to the Objection, that the Heart, ſo far as it is carnal, doth naturally make againſt this Doctrine; namely, If a Soul be onely juſtified by grace, through the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, doth not this then make void the Law, and all obedience to it? What need then of our Obedience? <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170425:89"/>
we eſtabliſh it;</hi> that is, the Doctrine of juſtification by Faith, doth rather eſtabliſh it. The Law doth ſtand eſtabliſht in a three-fold ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſht it by <hi>fulfilling it,</hi> whereby the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. Jeſus Chriſt perfectly fulfilled the Law, and kept it, and ſo makes over the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it to Believers, as hath been ſhewed; and ſo the Law ſtands eſtabliſht.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Law ſtands eſtabliſht as a meanes, through the Spirit, to <hi>convince</hi> of ſin, and of our ſhortneſs of the righteouſneſs of it; as <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And ſo Chriſt often made uſe of it for ſuch ends.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Law ſtands eſtabliſht, as an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, promiſed in the New Covenant to be written in the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>So that, though Jeſus Chriſt, in juſtifying by his bloud, hath quit the ſinner from all guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by the Law; yet he hath not given the Believer a diſcharge from all obedience of it: And therefore to evince this, I ſhall lay down this Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Though all a Believer hath done or can do, cannot juſtifie him before God; yet there are other bleſſed ends, why he ſhould obey God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obedience to God is placed as the great end of our redemption, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. — <hi>That we might ſerve him without fear</hi> (a fear of bondage) <hi>in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our life.</hi> God had not onely in his purpoſe the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation of the ſinner, but that thereby he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170425:90"/>
would have all that are called into this grace to ſerve him in Holineſs. And this end is to be upon the heart of the Believer, when juſtified by Faith: The purpoſe of God in this, is, that I ſhould ſerve him in holineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. That I ſhould live to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Soveraign Command of God,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. This is enough to a Believer, that God hath commanded it, though there ſhould be no other end in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is the Soul's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto God;</hi> it is a Beam of God, an Image of God, which he deſigns to be renewed upon all that ſhall be ſaved; as ſhall be further ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Juſtified Believers do ſee an equity, goodneſs, and bleſſedneſs in the Law of God, in all his holy and righteous Precepts, though they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The Law is holy, juſt, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking after the regenerate part. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 119. often, <hi>Thy Commandements which I have loved.</hi> They give God his due, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his due; and therefore to be walkt in, though not thereby juſtified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a principle of <hi>love to God, ſhed abroad in the heart</hi> of every juſtified Believer, from the ſenſe of his rich pardoning-grace, the freeneſs of his love, which acts and conſtrains a Soul to take delight, ſo far as it is regenerated, in every Command of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead; And that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not live to themſelves, but to him that dyed for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:170425:90"/>6. Called and juſtified Believers have <hi>bleſſed ſight</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that wonderfully take their hearts: they have glimpſes of the beauty of his Holineſs, and would therefore be made like unto him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. They would obey the Will of the Father, as Jeſus Chriſt did: They would be holy, and righteous, and wiſe, and patient, and Heavenly, as Jeſus Chriſt was.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Believers, in the way of their Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, have bleſſed fellowſhip and communion with God: Saith God of his Ordinances, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. <hi>There will I meet thee and commune with thee:</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. — <hi>In all places where I record my Name, there will I come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> They are everlaſting Promiſes to all the ways of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, wherein the people of God do walk before him in. They pray, they read, hear, they partake of the Supper in Chriſts way, and there they have life and bleſſing to their Soules, and many a ſweet inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of love and mercy they have whiſpered into them: they ſet themſelves to walk with God in his fear and counſel, and God walks with them; and their lives, if they keep cloſe to God, are ſweet and comfortable to them. And this is even as much to them, as if they were thereby juſtifyed: They would not miſs the ſweetneſs they meet with, in ſuch ways of Duty, for all the World.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By their Sanctification and Obedience, their juſtification is comfortably evidenced to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170425:91"/>
ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſinne unto Death, or of obedience unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> And —<hi>Ye know that every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him,</hi> 1 Ioh. 2.29. <hi>We know, that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> So that, no doubt, Believers may come to a ſweet and bleſſed Evidence of their good eſtate, and of their juſtification, by the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in them, and their willing obedience to <hi>God,</hi> though a Believer doth not always, and at all times, fetch in his Evidence of Believing, and of comfort this way; but ſometimes from the Promiſe, and from the more immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit. But though a Believer doth not, and it may be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, always fetch in his conſolation and peace from Sanctification and Obedience: yet that Soul that wholly neglects it, and ſleights Evidences from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Sanctification, and Obedience, had beſt timely look to it, that the Witneſs in himſelf he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, be not from imagination of his own heart, from the wicked ones deluſion, and from ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notions of grace that may affect his heart, but leave him on this ſide Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Believers do perform their Duties, as <hi>returnes</hi> to God: Every called Believer ſaith in his heart, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.12. Oh! <hi>What ſhall I render to thee?</hi> How gracious hath God been? and now how holy ſhould I be? Who ſhall love the Lord, and fear before him, and praiſe him, if I ſhall not? To whom ſhall his Name, Laws, Ordinances, be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if not unto me? Who is more bound to love
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170425:91"/>
the bleſſed God then I? and how ſhall I love him but by obeying him? Thus doth a Believer perform his obedience, as a teſtimony of a thankful return to God; though I do not ſay, that this is all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By the Obedience and Holineſs of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, God is much glorifyed in the World; 'tis the greateſt glory that God deſigns to himſelf in the World, even by the holineſs, and willing-gracious obedience of his people to him. When the World lyes in wickedneſs, and makes War againſt the great and holy God, this is that which Honours God, that he hath a people, called by his grace, that ſet forth the glory of holineſs in the world, that are witneſſes to the holineſs of God, the holineſs of his Worſhip, and all his Ways, and profeſs and endeavour to walk in them; and by this, others are brought on to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God on their behalf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It may ſerve for inſtruction and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your judgments and Conſciences, that there are other bleſſed, and neceſſary and holy Ends, in the Sanctification and Obedience of a Believer, though they do not pacifie God, nor juſtifie the Believer, nor procure mercy, by way of worthineſs, to a poor Soul called thereunto; which may therefore ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the damnableneſs of ſuch kind of Doctrines, that teach, and cry in this day, Grace is free, Chriſt hath done all; what need you pray, and have Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and be holy? This is of the wicked one, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170425:92"/>
comes from his Inſtruments and Factors, who are ſent abroad to damn Soules: You may ſee, that not one of thoſe Ends mentioned, but is of weight enough to convince a ſoul of the neceſſity of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Duties, and Obedience; and ſuch mens preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not a Scripture-way of Free-grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there are bleſſed and holy Ends of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Duties and Obedience, though he is not thereby juſtifyed, It may ſerve to take off that prejudice of heart, through miſunderſtanding and ignorance, that is apt to be upon the hearts of ſuch as are Carnal, when they hear that all their Duties, Sobriety, and Righteouſneſs, is to be accounted as loſs for Chriſt. You ſee there are good and neceſſary Ends of all Duties of Obedience; onely ſtill take this with you, and to your Conſciences, that <hi>till</hi> you come as poor and naked to Ieſus Chriſt, for your juſtifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo get life in, and from him, and ſo are carryed on in a way of Duty; Your Duties ſerve you for no end and purpoſe, unleſs for a leſſer degree of Torment in Hell: onely be encouraged, to wait upon the means for the receiving of the Spirit, for the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt: And theſe things, I have ſpoken, may be your Experience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may further direct Believers, what ends they are to propoſe to themſelves, in the way of their Duties and Obedience, to be carryed on in them through the grace of GOD, and the daily
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170425:92"/>
ſupply of the Spirit, as one great end of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that you ſhould ſerve the Lord in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to eye the Soveraign and Abſolute Command of God over you; that thereby you are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to God, and ſhew forth his Image, and to the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; that there is an equity and goodneſs in all the Holy and Righteous Ways of God.</p>
               <p>And ſee that the love of God be ſhed abroad in your hearts, to draw out your love to him, and ſo be acted in your obedience. Get your hearts taken with the beauty and glory of the Lord Jeſus, and ſo, long after likeneſs to him: See that you look after Communion with God in your Duties, and that you do not neglect your Evidence for the Pardon of your ſinnes, by the ſight of your Sanctification, and your Univerſal Obedience: And perform them not, as to procure mercy, by any proportion thereunto in your Duties, but as Returns to God; and conſider how much God is glorifyed in the World, by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his people.</p>
               <p>And thus may you carry on your progreſs in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and a ſweet and conſciencious performance of Duties, and walking with God; and yet live by your Faith for your juſtification, by the rich and Free-grace of God, through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as if you had never obeyed at all.</p>
               <p>In a word, If thou haſt felt the power and vertue of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt upon thy Soul, coming
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170425:93"/>
as a poor, naked, polluted, guilty Soul unto it (as thou haſt been ſhewed) and haſt received life from Jeſus Chriſt, by a believing, cloſing with him; and art waiting for a ſight and ſenſe of thy juſtification, but doeſt yet want it; Remember ſtill, that in the performance of thy Duties, thy heart (which it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to do) lay no ſtreſs upon them, as in them to appear before God, and to procure the favour of God, but ſtill go forth to the grace, bloud righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, promiſes of Chriſt, and there fix for thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, and be much in renewing of Acts of Faith; that is, caſting thy Soul upon them, and Evidence will come in; yet go on in humbling praying, waiting reforming, ſanctifying, obeying, as to the ends mentioned: And the peace of God fill thy heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Believers that have ſome ſenſe of their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, do you remember, that you obey God, not that thereby you were, are, or ever may be juſtified; but becauſe you <hi>are</hi> juſtified: therefore you obey the Lord, and delight in his wayes; keep this in your eye, and 'twill keep the heart from going to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome upon your ſelves, as gracious, and partly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which mixtures, render Duties uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and keep ſouls from aſſurance: No Believer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his Duties ſo ſpiritually, ſweetly, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, as that ſoul that labours to keep the ſight of his juſtification ſtill, upon the account of Free-grace and out of himſelf; that ſoul enjoys ſweeteſt Communion with God in the way of his Duties,

            <p>I Have been opening the difference between the Righteouſneſs of the Law and the Goſpel, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Neceſſity, Nature, and Way of obtaining Goſpel-juſtification, by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and have diſcovered a ſoul eſtated therein; I ſhall now endeavour to open the <hi>Goſpel-New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> peculiarly, as diſtinguiſht from that which is called (in appearance) a Legal-New-Creature, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170425:95"/>Now let a ſoul fail in either of theſe, and loſt for ever: fail of a ſaving-cloze with Jeſus Chriſt for righteouſneſs, or being a New Creature in Chriſt, and you periſh in your ſins, and the wrath of God will overtake you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now take up time in opening the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the words; nor will it much be deſired, as to our Deſign: I ſhall therefore draw this plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from them; namely,</p>
            <p>Obſerv. <hi>There's an abſolute neceſſity, in order to the Salvation of every ſoul, to become a New Creature in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>

Thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of the neceſſity of being <hi>born again of the Spirit,</hi> Ioh. 3.3, 5. and of being <hi>converted</hi> Mal. 18.3. do evince the ſame truth. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion avail any thing, but a New Creature.

            <p>The neceſſity of this New-Creature doth ariſe,;</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>tenour of the New-Covenant,</hi> in which way God hath obliged himſelf to give out mercy; and in no other.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170425:95"/>
promiſeth to give to all, he takes into a Covenant of mercy and peace with himſelf. <hi>I will put a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and a new Heart will I give unto you,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. Wherein, as we ſhall ſhew, lyes the ſpecial part of the New Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Whoſoever ſhall be ſaved, ſhall be a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the great Deſign of God, in giving out his Son Jeſus Chriſt, which was, that all the Elect ſhould be made conformable to the Image of his Son <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many Brethren.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is called the <hi>expreſs Image of the Father,</hi> Hebr. 1. And to that <hi>Image</hi> all Believers ſhall be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Jeſus Chriſt, the firſt-born, and all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to be made conformable unto him.

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:170425:96"/>4.

While you have nothing but the <hi>Old-Adam,</hi> you are corrupt, and polluted, and abominable. If you ſhall become the Brethren of the firſt-born Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt bear his Image, and have it renewed upon you. Oh you that are yet in your <hi>old ſins,</hi> and walk after your <hi>Old-Luſts,</hi> you are not New-Creatures: You will not think ſo; therefore ſit down with this Conviction, That as yet you have no part in this bleſſedneſs. Oh! All of you who are the <hi>ſame</hi> that ever you were, whether living in groſs ſins, or ſober and civil from your Youth up, you are yet of the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but corrupt Nature upon you: your hope is vain, and you are blinded in your ſins, and the grace of God is not in you.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:170425:96"/>2. Oh! Let me before I go further, put this to tryall, and ſuffer the word of the Lord which ſhall one day judge you; Can you ſay in good earneſt, <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new in me?</hi> Now I am a veſſell in the hand of God, wrought by his Spirit, and there is through infinite grace, a new <hi>work manſhip</hi> upon my ſoul? I ſhall lay down rules for the particular diſcovery of this: only at preſent, yeild up your conſcience to the power of the world, do not ſlink from under it; If it find you out in your ſin, in nature, the ſame that ever you were, give glory to God, and ſay, The word of the Lord is quick and powerfull, and go off with this conviction in power upon thy ſoul, I never expect to go to heaven and glory, if I become not (through grace) a new Creature.</p>
            <p>But before I go further, I would open, that every ſoul that is a new Creature, muſt be in Chriſt; and why.</p>
            <p>So ſaith the Apoſtle to theſe <hi>Corinths,</hi> in this Epiſtle, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves, know you not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates!</hi> ye are <hi>created into Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.10.</p>
            <p>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt out as a branch, and is withered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6.</p>
            <p>Now herein lyes the great Myſtery of Godlineſſe, into which all our evidences for Heaven are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore this is a weighty enquiry. I am to ſpeak of it, ſpecially, as it relates to the making and forming by the new Creature.</p>
            <p>This being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> is expreſſed by being <hi>rooted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.7. <hi>Planted into him,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>Built up in him,</hi> Col. 2. All which beſpeak a reall <hi>union</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:170425:97"/>
with him; that this is not a mere imaginary thing, but as true and reall, as the union between the root and the branches, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. and the foundation and the building, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. which is wrought, by the Spirit of the Lord Ieſus, drawing and uniting true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto him; The ſame Spirit dwelling in them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11.— <hi>By his Sprit that dwelleth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to conſider, Why all that are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the Goſpell, muſt be ſo <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as are Goſpell <hi>New-Creatures</hi> muſt be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe if they be <hi>New-Creatures,</hi> they muſt be <hi>Living</hi> Creatures. Now God hath laid up all <hi>life,</hi> that ſhall be diſpenced forth, in his Son Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.21.26.— <hi>The Son quickneth whom he will;</hi> for as the the Father hath life in himſelf, <hi>So he hath given to the Son to have Life in himſelf; Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> Iohn 14.19. Now naturally all ſinners are <hi>dead</hi> in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and utterly unable to beget life in themſelves: who can make alive his own ſoul? but when they were New-born as new Creatures, they are ſaid to be quickned in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. As God breathed life into man at firſt, and ſo he became a living ſoul; ſo in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> the ſoul is ſaid to be <hi>created into Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.10. and to be made <hi>Alive in him,</hi> Rom. 6.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there were not a reall union of the ſoul with Chriſt, life (if it ſhould be given without it) would not be preſerved in the ſoul, <hi>Thou holdeſt our ſoul in life,</hi> Pſal. 66.9. As the branch, through it was once quickned, cannot preſerve it life, if cut off from the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170425:97"/>
root; And therefore a continued ſupply of life from Jeſus Chriſt, to the ſoul, is neceſſary as to all its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actings as a new Creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By being in Chriſt, the ſoul is made <hi>partaker of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. by which the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, all gracious habits, are infuſed in the ſoul, whereby the New-Creature is formed up, in believers. Hence it is, that all grace and holineſſe is infuſed into the ſoul, as diſtinguiſh'd from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, that at laſt withereth, <hi>John</hi> 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered,</hi> &amp;c. therefore a neceſſity of being in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Without being in Chriſt, the power and raign of ſin, the body of ſin, will not be deſtroyed; no deſtroying the body of ſin, by any poſſible endeavors, but by the influence of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and a reall fellowſhip therewith, which cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by being planted into Chriſt; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>For if we have bin planted together into the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin be deſtroyed, that hence forth we might not ſerve ſin;</hi> All the proper morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying power that believers have of the body of ſin, is drawn from fellowſhip with the death of Ieſus Chriſt, which fellowſhip ariſeth only from being one with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Image of God cannot be renewed upon us, but in Chriſt? <hi>As we have born the Image of the Earthly, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the heavenly;</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. So, Rom. 8.29.—we are <hi>made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Image of his Son;</hi> By union a ſoul is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170425:98"/>
made partaker of the fulneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, as all grace is laid up in him, and of that fulneſſe partakes by meaſure of every grace from him; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulneſſe have all we received, and grace for grace;</hi> that is, grace according to the patern of Jeſus Chriſt, partaking of every grace in him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure allowed to every member and branch in him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Without being in Chriſt, no duty is accepted with God; by being in Chriſt, we are accepted in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby all the dutyes of a Child of God are accepted with the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. as performed by a principle of life from Ieſus Chriſt, and offered up to God in the name and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; otherwiſe let praying and all other dutyes be never ſo ſtrictly, frequently, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly performed, they find no acceptance with God, and the ſoul is not bettered by them: <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> John 15. ſaith Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Without being in Jeſus Chriſt, there can be no holy fruit in converſation brought forth to God, John 15.5. <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit;</hi> All the fruit that is of our own ſtock, comes to nought, but the fruit that is brought forth in Chriſt, from implantation into him, is precious; fruit unto repentance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and doing of any good, unleſſe it proceed from the life we have in Chriſt is Phariſaical, and comes to nothing, and will be burnt up in the day of the Lord; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſanctified believers are call'd the trees of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. as planted engrafted into Jeſus Chriſt, whereby they bring forth all their favory fruit unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:170425:98"/>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> See now the great and weighty, and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſity of getting into Chriſt, of having union with him, the main pillar upon which hangs all your Comfort; Do what you will and be out of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and tis an accurſed loathed ſacrifice; Do what thou wilt from thy own ſtock, and 'tis bitter fruit; A dram of what is performed in Chriſt, is of more worth then a mighty daily bulk of dutyes without it; not hereby to leſſen a believer, as to muchneſſe of duty, but to ſhew the unacceptableneſs of all duties, though never ſo <hi>many, long, devout,</hi> till a poor ſoul performes all from a new principle, and power of life in the ſoul from Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo a new Creature.</p>
            <p>Oh! that poor ſouls were thoroughly convinc'd of this, who, ſo they perform dutyes, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this. Oh! lay to heart thy <hi>dead</hi> condition, and the infinite neceſſity of getting into Chriſt: No life in thy ſoul, no preſerving of life, till Jeſus Chriſt; nothing of the divine nature upon thee, no deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, nothing of the Image of God upon thee; that is ſaving; no duty accepted, no fruit unto God in thy converſation, till thou haſt the reall experience of this bleſſed Myſtery in thy ſoul, of being one in Chriſt, through the ſpirit, till thy ſoul knoweth what union &amp; fellowſhip with the Son of God meaneth; Therefore ſouls that fall ſhort here, their knowledge, profeſſion, converſation is loſt labour, is to the great matter of eternall life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If all that are truly and ſavingly <hi>New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are in Chriſt;</hi> then a New-Creature any other way, is but a ſemblance and appearance of it, and not ſo indeed and reality; If from our ſelves, from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170425:99"/>
the power of the Law upon the Conſcience, or upon any other account whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I ſtill ſay, the more we conſider of this matter, of the more narrow enquiry do we find it to be.</p>
            <p>There is a ſemblance and likeneſſe, of being New-Creatures, which is not really ſo, a ſemblance of holineſſe, a holy fruit, which is not truly ſo, but will at laſt wither; and hence, all the withered profeſſours in this day, as we ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here ſpeak of ſuch, as pretend to no manner of change inward or outward, ſuch as are in all things, the ſame that ever they were, as ſuch as live in known groſſe ſins, they have no appearance or pretence of claim to the Title and Character of the New-Creature; By their own conceſſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment they are ſtill the ſame as ever they were, therefore, not ſo much as pretend to be made New; to ſuch I ſhall, if God will, apply a further word before we have done.</p>
            <p>Onely now of the <hi>ſemblance</hi> of the New-Creature, (falſely ſo called) but not really ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſoul being convinc'd of the damnableneſſe, of ſuch and ſuch a ſin, from the Law, and the power of the word upon the Conſcience, that a ſoul living, continuing in it, ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God: as from ſuch a place, as, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God, Be not deceived, neither Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Adulterers, Idolaters, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor Theeves, nor Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170425:99"/>
ſhall inherit the kingdome of God, And ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay from this or the like Scripture, a ſoul may be convinced, that if he continued in any of theſe groſſe wickedneſſes, he ſhall never ſee the face of God, and ſo may take up from the groſſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of them, or, at leaſt, from a frequent committing them; Now this perſon may go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and becauſe he hath left ſome ſpeciall groſſe ſin, he thinks himſelf a true Convert, and a New-man, and may flatter himſelf with the conceit of being the New-Creature we are to ſet forth; but no New <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man, no coming to Chriſt, nor being in Chriſt; And, it may be feared, many ſouls are under this dreadfull ſnare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such a kind of outward Reformation, may ariſe from ſpecial judgment, and affliction upon a ſinner, trembling that God hath ſmitten him for ſuch a ſin, and ſo may take up from it; and this alſo often paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for converſion; not but that ſometimes God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the firſt ſtroke by laying his hand upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but I ſpeak of a mere taking up from a profane courſe, and never getting into Jeſus Chriſt, which many reſt themſelves in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſinner may leave ſome ſins of youth, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with riper years; and upon that, may take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Convert, or a kind of New-Creature, to be changed and turned from what he was; but no forſaking this ſin with loathing of it, as againſt God, no unbrokenneſſe of heart for it, and the root of it ſtill unſubdued in his heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A ſinner may take up from ſome groſſe ſins, as inconſiſtent with reputation, <hi>credit</hi> in the world, or his <hi>profit</hi> and worldly advantage, ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170425:100"/>
perſons turn to be great worldlings, and yet take themſelves to be good Converts, when they have turned from a ſin that would waſt their eſtates, to be wretched worldlings; yet theſe go away with a good opinion, of themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sinners may take up and reforme, to get the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome Religious Friend, or great perſon that doth countenance Religion, in hope of ſome ſpecial preferment or honour by them, and ſo get a forme of profeſſion, an ability to ſpeak of good things, own the beſt people, hear good men, and yet all this proceed from a rotten heart; as was with <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. hoping after great gain by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, the gift of Miracles, and yet was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Souls may have a kind of reall conviction, and taking up to ſome new dutyes, in the ſinfull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of which they have long lived; as to a kind of ſecret prayer, in obſerving the Sabbath more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, read more, hear more, (things good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when uſed as meanes to find Jeſus Chriſt in) and yet may continue long in theſe; and not a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell New-Creature in Chriſt; Never humbled ſo as to be emptyed of themſelves, and come to Jeſus Chriſt, as for righteouſneſſe, ſo for life and ſtrength for the performance of all dutyes, and ſubduing of all ſin, and herein chiefly the Legall New-Creature (ſo called) doth conſiſt, in taking up to moſt known outward dutyes, ſomething ſtrictly, (yea ſometimes more then a ſoul that is in Chriſt) and make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them, as of groſſe outward ſins: and yet no Goſpel New-Creature. I wiſh there are not too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:170425:100"/>7. A ſoul may take himſelf to be a new-Creature, from ſome good liking that he hath of ſuch as are better then himſelf, and ſome <hi>purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to be better; which purpoſes for a time carry a man forth, till new temptations, and then they will not bear a man forth; Thus you ſhall find many ſinners purpoſing and ſtrongly reſolving to take up, to avoid ſuch courſes they have found to end in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet fall back again, becauſe purpoſing in themſelves, and not getting into Chriſt for ſtrength: and theſe think themſelves to be a kind of New-Creatures.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Yea further, a ſoul may be under ſome terrours of conſcience for a time, and yet heal and relieve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a leaving the ſin outwardly that occaſioned ſuch terrour, and taking up to a greater bulk and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall courſe and round of ſet duties; under which ſuch ſouls enſafe themſelves and ſettle in a kind of peace, and take themſelves to be New-Creatures, becauſe they were under terrours, and forſake ſome ſins, and performe more duties, and yet never hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, nor have taken root in him.</p>
            <p>Before I go any further, let me bring home, if the Lord will, theſe things to your Conſciences, and let it be a word to find out ſuch whoſe conditions have bin opened.</p>
            <p>Such then of you, who haply have left ſome groſſe ſins, ſome open profane courſes, becauſe the word of God hath glar'd upon your conſciences, and you could not commit ſuch ſins in peace, that upon ſome ſpeciall affliction have taken up to a little ſtricter courſe, that have left the ſins of your youth,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170425:101"/>
onely becauſe they were youthful ſins, not ſutable to riper age, or have ceas'd from Lewd courſes, becauſe of your credit among men, or your worldly profits, ſins in which you could not thrive in your eſtates; If this be all, know it, that your are not the New-Creatures, we are ſpeaking of, you are far from the kingdom of God; and if you come no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to ſee your ſelves wholly at a loſſe, and ſo get to Ieſus Chriſt, you are damned for ever.</p>
            <p>Yea if any for the favour of men, or ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage, have taken up a ſeeming profeſſion of Religion above the ordinary rate, and this be your main principle; know thou art ſeven times the Child of the Devil, more then thou waſt, to deal thus Atheiſtically and Hypocritically with the great God, who will one day lay thee open to all the world, and thou ſhall be confounded in thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this thy abominable iniquity.</p>
            <p>And ſuch as have come a little further, that from ſome conviction of your ſhortneſſe, of what you ſhould be, have betaken your ſelves to a greater bulk of duties, make conſcience of many ſins and many duties, and ſo you have ſetled your ſelves in your courſe; know you alſo, this you may do, and be far from Goſpel New-Creatures.</p>
            <p>Such alſo as reſt in purpoſes and reſolutions, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſome wouldings to be better, this will not do, if it be no more; or ſuch as have heald your ſelves, and have not bin healed by coming to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by a more exact way of ſome outward duties; know it, and be convinc'd, that the core will break out again, and you are yet to ſeek
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170425:101"/>
for a well grounded peace; and are none of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel New-Creatures.</p>
            <p>Now another degree of miſtakes of the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth ariſe from the taking of <hi>Common grace,</hi> (which a Hypocrite may reach to) for truth of <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſanctifying grace; And know, that every Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite doth not know himſelf to be ſuch, but a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is one that appeares to himſelf, and others to be what he is not; He takes himſelf to be a good Chriſtian, a believer, a new Creature, and is not ſo: The ground of ſome of theſe great miſtakes, I ſhall mention.</p>
            <p>As firſt, A poor Creature thinks himſelf ſafe, becauſe what he doth, he thinks he doth it all with <hi>a good heart.</hi> No one ſo confident of the goodneſſe of his heart as a Hypocrite, becauſe he knowes not his own heart, in that great Reformation in <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. that <hi>Iudah turned</hi> to the Lord, but <hi>feignedly, not with the whole heart:</hi> yet the people thought otherwiſe of themſelves, as tis likely, when they entred into a Covenant with God, with good <hi>Ioſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is it that moſt poor ſinfull Creatures do bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up themſelves with, in their ignorance and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that they do all to God and men with good hearts; whereas a renewed ſoul doubts of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart, and hath matter of humbling for it, in every duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another miſtake of poor ſouls is, (as to the Goſpel New-Creature,) from a <hi>mispriſion of ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> for ſuch as are indeed <hi>reigning damning ſins;</hi> As to inſtance, to lye for advantage, to ſwear petty Oaths ſometimes, by faith and troth, by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170425:102"/>
maſſe, to mention Gods name frequently, as a by-word, crying Oh Lord, Oh God, ſlightly, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſometimes to drink to exceſſe, or the like evils; 'Tis common to hear wretched ſouls, when convinc'd of them, to excuſe the matter, Why, 'tis their <hi>infirmity,</hi> whereas it proceeds from a heart wholly unregenerate, and under the power and reign of ſin.</p>
            <p>Infirmities of the Children of God, are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, but humbled for, mourned for, every day watch'd againſt, the root of them they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to mortifie through the Spirit; which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſour that calls all his ſins his infirmities, doth not, Oh! Souls, there's a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the infirmities of ſuch as are indeed <hi>New-Creatures,</hi> and between the reigning ſins of naturall men; ſin reigns in its peace, power, habit, in the heart no ſubduing, crucifying purging, which a New-Creature doth and hath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This miſtake of the New-Creature doth ariſe from a miſconceiving of the reluctancy of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſcience, before or in the committing of ſin; taking it for the conflict that is in a truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Soul, between the Regenerate and the carnall part; which miſtake uſually is bottomed upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.15. <hi>For that which I do, I allow not,</hi> &amp;c. Hence ſay many unregenerate, graceleſſe perſons, Why, though they do break out into ſuch and ſuch hings, and omit ſuch and ſuch duties, yet they do not <hi>allow</hi> themſelves in it; that is, their conſcience is not wholly ſeared, and ſo make ſome reſiſtance, and this they take to be ſaving grace; A groſſe and moſt dangerous miſtake;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170425:102"/>
Now take ſuch a perſon, and he hath <hi>not a delight in the Law of God, in the inward man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. doth not cry out as inwardly burthen'd, <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> No ſuch daily complaints and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the weight of it, No tying God through Jeſus Chriſt for deliverance from it, No ſerving the Law of God with a renewed inward man, No walking after the Spirit; as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth to do; ſo that unleſſe it be ſo with you, that no-allowance, in the conſcience and yet do it, it comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and an Hypocrite may and doth as much, till given up to a ſeared conſcience, paſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From a miſtake of <hi>faith,</hi> taking that for ſound and ſaving, which is common to a Reprobate; ſuch as <hi>James</hi> deſcribes in his Epiſtle; ſpeaking of men, who <hi>ſay they have faith,</hi> and have not really; A faith that believes that God is; the Scriptures; the dying and riſing of Jeſus Chriſt, and all other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell truths, as it pretends; yea that he believes on Jeſus Chriſt, and hopes to be ſaved by him, as well as the holieſt; and upon this they have a kind of peace. I have ſpoken before of Juſtifying faith; only a word as to the New-Creature; know therefore, That faith which hath convinc'd the ſoul of its own weakneſſe, and ſo brought it to Jeſus Chriſt, for life, that doth not teach a ſoul to deny it ſelf, that doth not purifie the heart, that doth not live upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo created into him, is not the faith of the New-Creature, but a common dead putrifying faith, that ſuffers the ſoul to putrifie in ſin, and works not to the cleanſing of it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:170425:103"/>5. To inſtance in ſome other graces; as, namely, <hi>repentance,</hi> which ſouls do take to be onely a wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin had not bin committed with a little fear and ſorrow after it, and this they think to be true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; which when true, is accompanyed with loathing of the ſin, and our ſelves, and our corrupt natures, brokenneſſe of heart for it, and from it, and turning to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and eyes the honour, patience, holineſſe, love of God in its ſorrowing, more then his wrath; and hath for its effects, <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, indignation</hi> againſt it ſelf, <hi>vehement deſire</hi> after more holineſſe by Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A falſe and carnall <hi>hope</hi> of Heaven, miſtaken for a gracious <hi>ſaving hope</hi> deceives the ſoul in this matter; many poor ſouls, yea, it may be feared, the moſt, think they ſhall go to Heaven, becauſe they <hi>hope</hi> ſo; and think they ought to hope; Now a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hope of pardon and Heaven is rightly bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd, namely upon the riches of Gods grace, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.7. Upon the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. Upon ſome ſpeciall promiſe of God; Upon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of God,</hi> Rom. 5. And <hi>purifies the ſoul,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. as I may have occaſion more at large to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Oh! this falſe and carnall curſed hope, that is not thus bottom'd, ſerves onely to ſhut up the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of the word, and a ſaving cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt; till a ſoul is daſht in this hope, it will never get a better.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A <hi>form of knowledge,</hi> ſpecially if <hi>encreas'd</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtery of the word, may much deceive a ſoul in this great and weighty concernment; ſo <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:170425:103"/>
ſpeaks of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. having <hi>a form of knowledge, and of the truth of the Law;</hi> Many have a Catechiſticall form of knowledge, they can deſcribe what faith, and repentance, and regeneration is, and then think they have it themſelvs, becauſe they can <hi>tell</hi> what it is, and do believe it to be ſuch; There may be much knowledge in the head, and yet no renewing grace in the heart; That knowledge that is ſaving brings with it a power upon the ſoul, to love, delight in, to experience the goodneſſe, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſweetneſſe of what it knows: It transforms the ſoul into the image of what is known, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> It is ſpirituall and it makes the heart, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſpirituall.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A miſconceit of the <hi>grace of love</hi> is alſo a falſe ground in this matter: As that a poor ſoul will think that he loves God, when he hath no knowledge of him, nor delight in him, nor Communion with him; nor doth love his Image, which is holineſſe; And that he loves All, every one, whereas much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and malice reigns in the hearts, if but a little provoked; And for the people of God, truly ſo called, they hate them for Hypocrites, Schiſmaticks, and what not? or if a little better thoughts of them, tis not love to Chriſt, and his Image in them, that acts them, which is the nature of the grace of love.</p>
            <p n="9">9. So is patience, humility, meekneſſe, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; ſome natural diſpoſitions are more patient and meek, and theſe poor Creatures are apt to miſtake for grace, when 'tis nothing but mere nature, and more candid diſpoſition; And ſuch Souls, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall temper can bear much, and it hath an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170425:104"/>
of grace; But yet here may be no work of the Spirit all this while, humbling, meekning the ſoul in its own vileneſſe, no mortification of contrary luſts, No humbling for pride of heart, without which no true gracious humility; No meekning by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the power of Chriſts love upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; And yet upon this account, you ſhall have poor carnall ſouls pretend much (as I have often heard it urged by them) to the fruits of Spirit, mention'd, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. of love, joy, peace, goodneſſe, patience, temperance, when tis nothing but diſpoſition, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, or from civil education.</p>
            <p n="10">10. As great a deceit there is about the <hi>fear of God;</hi> many poor ſouls do fear the puniſhment and wrath of God, which is all they do, and then they think this is the fear of his ſervants; The fear of the Lord, which God promiſeth to put in the hearts of his own people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. is a fear of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is holy, becauſe he is gracious, becauſe he hath pardoned iniquity; <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſſe, Hoſ.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> which fear is mixt with a ſweet and bleſſed love to God, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A <hi>miſapprehenſion of good workes,</hi> cauſeth a miſtake of the New-Creature; many are convinc'd that workes of mercy and charity and Juſtice are to be done, and ſo, from a pittifull nature, or from vain-glory, or from a ſecrer thought to appeaſe God, or from Legall conviction at leaſt, they will be ready to do Charitable works, (things good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) and this they think diſcovers their Faith; And herein lyes a common deceit in the vulgar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the people of <hi>England;</hi> Now all the good
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170425:104"/>
works (falſly ſo call'd) done out of Chriſt, are fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not accepted with God, A papiſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a carnall proteſtant, (even alſo for the ſin of his ſoul) doth much this way; But good works, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, do flow from a living faith, from love to Jeſus Chriſt, and deſigne, not a ſelf-juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but the glory of God; And gracious ſouls do find it very hard to performe them, with holy ends.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Miſtake of <hi>a good converſation;</hi> which may onely be a morall converſation, civill, ſober, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to men, but mindes not <hi>holineſſe</hi> to God, which is the ſpeciall part of a Goſpel-Converſation: And yet the moſt of people go away with this, that they are believers, and in a good eſtate for heaven, becauſe they have a good converſation, which they greatly miſtake. That which the word of God calls a good converſation, as an evidence of faith, is not onely a mere outward blameleſneſſe (which the Phariſees had), but to walk with God, from a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-principle, from Goſpel-Grace, and the love of God in the heart, chiefly reſpecting holineſſe to the Lord, and the fear of the Lord upon the heart; now a ſoul that hath nothing of this may be outwardly blameleſſe, a Jew and heathen may be ſo, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the grace of God upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Now the Lord make this to be a convincing ſearching word to you; you that have left ſome groſſe ſins, from the word upon your conſciences, from afflictions, from worldly advantages from age; be it known unto you, this you may do, and more, and be ſtill the Children of wrath, in an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, and not the New-Creatures we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170425:105"/>
are ſpeaking of; yea though thou haſt taken up to new duties, and makeſt conſcience of many ſins, and many duties, thou mayſt ſtill be out of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And you that call your daily ſins (which have <hi>dominion</hi> over you) your infirmities, when not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, nor mourn for them, nor cry for ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, this your way is your folly, and the Devil and your own hearts greatly deceive you; yea you call ſuch ſins your infirmities, (meaning as if they were the infirmities of the Children of God) that cannot conſiſt with truth of grace, ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lying, and common profaning the Lords name in your mouths, and neglecting to ſanctifie his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and living in the neglect of ſecret ſpirituall prayer.</p>
            <p>And ſuch of you that have ſome ſtriving in your conſciences, before and after the ſin, know it, it may be ſo, and yet not a drop of ſaving grace in you, no regenerate part wrought forth in you; And yet how many bear up themſelves upon this ſcore: and think thence they allow not themſelves in the ſins they commit, in <hi>Paul's</hi> ſenſe: look to this, or you may for ever periſh in this ſnare, I have given ſome markes how you may know it.</p>
            <p>Take you heed alſo, that you take not that which is called <hi>Common-Grace,</hi> which is Common to Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, for true grace. There's is a falſe faith, a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, a falſe Hope, and ſo of the reſt, in which you may aſſuredly go to Hell; you may have a harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe converſation, and do ſome good works of Charity and yet periſh for ever, you may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the New-Creature in you; and yet give all your goods to the poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:170425:105"/>In a word, you may leave outward groſſe ſins, have convictions of wrath to come, have purpoſes, (ſuch as they are) to be better, take up to New-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have common grace, think you have faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hope that you are humble, patient, have a good converſation, and do good works; and yet not be New-Creatures in Jeſus Chriſt, as we ſhall further evince.</p>
            <p>I have yet one more deceit to diſcover, and that is, the miſtake of a Scripture-<hi>good conſcience;</hi> It is true, that the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, 19. puts <hi>faith and a good conſcience</hi> as the great Comprehenſive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but there is not any one thing more miſtaken, then what this <hi>good conſcience</hi> is; Too many Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſſe this carnally, and carnall people go away with it, that they have Faith, yea they never doubt it, and for a good conſcience they diſcharge it; I have ſpoken of Faith already, but now that which ſuch poor ſeduced ſouls take to be a good Conſcience, is onely to wrong no body, to be juſt to all, not to purloyn others goods, to take and keep nothing but their own; they take it to be chiefly converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the duties of the ſecond table, concerning their Neighbour; A little to rectifie this ſoul-damning miſtake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Scripture-Conſcience</hi> is an <hi>enlightened conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which before was ſhut up in darkneſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. The light of the word of God is ſet up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereby it diſcovers thoſe truths in their power and worth, which before it was dark unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A good conſcience is a <hi>conſcience ſearcht</hi> by the power of the word, <hi>convinc'd</hi> to be under ſin, and guilt, and pollution, whereby trouble doth ariſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170425:106"/>
in it; God laying in the weight of guilt, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of ſinne, the pollution of it, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; ſo that the ſoul cries out, What ſhall I do? How ſhall God be pacified, and the ſoul ſaved?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And hence it is, an <hi>awakened Conſcience,</hi> which before was aſleep; <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> Eph. 5. The voice of the Spirit doth awaken that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that before was aſleep in ſinful ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A good Conſcience is convinced, that all the keepings of the Law, and keeping a Conſcience to men, cannot juſtifie the ſoul before God, cannot commend it to God, which a Second-Table-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience imagines it will, and ſo is in peace: <hi>Paul</hi> kept a Conſcience as to many things, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience before God untill this day;</hi> meaning, I conceive, from his youth up, when he was a Phariſee; but when his Conſcience was convinced and awakened, and came to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, he ſaw that all his keeping a Conſcience, as to many Sins and Duties, could not in the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A good Conſcience is ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. So that this is the efficacy of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Conſcience of a Believer, it pacifies it in the ſenſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins towards God, ſo as it can draw near to God; and it purgeth it from dead works, ſin,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170425:106"/>
and pollution, to ſerve God acceptably. This is a good Conſcience indeed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>A good Conſcience reſpects all the Precepts of God,</hi> as well of <hi>Holineſs</hi> to God, as Goodneſs to men; which the Conſcience we have been ſpeaking of, doth not. Such a one makes not conſcience of this great and abſolute Precept, <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. It makes not conſcience of purging the heart, of ſecret mourning to God, of the purity of Gods Worſhip: It makes no Conſcience of leſſer ſins, as we have ſhew'd, not of <hi>all</hi> ſin; as <hi>Herod</hi> heard the Word gladly, but made no conſcience of perſecuting <hi>John</hi> to death, when he ſtood in the way of his Luſts: Now, I ſay, a good Conſcience reſpects precepts of Holineſs, ſecret as well as publique Duties, inward as well as outward ſins, leſſer ſins as well as greater.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Scripture-good Conſcience <hi>is much taken up about godly ſincerity.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our Conſciences that with ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but with the grace of God we have had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus a ſoul that walks with a good Conſcience towards God labours to a prove it ſelf in all things, with a godly ſincerity, to do all as unto God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a good Conſcience labours to keep it ſelf pure and undefiled it is accompanied with a <hi>pure heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Now the end of the Commandement is love out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned.</hi> A ſoul that would keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience good, would keep it pure, and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man pure, as a Temple unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170425:107"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Now ſee how many ingredients go to make up a <hi>good Conſcience</hi> in a Scripture-ſenſe, and what a great miſtake is in this weighty matter; and how far, abundance of people that make conſcience of their dealings with men, conclude thence they have a Scripture-good-conſcience to God, when they are not ſavingly enlightned, their Conſcience never ſearcht by the power of the Word, and throughly awakened out of a natural condition, never hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for reſting in themſelves and their Duties, not having their Conſcience ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and purged thereby, not having a tender reſpect to all the Precepts of God, not to walk before him in godly ſincerity, nor with a pure heart. You then that are ſhort of theſe things, you are wholly to ſeek in that which you ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and ſpeak peace to your ſelves in, the having or keeping a good Conſcience; you have as yet no part in this matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What hath been ſpoken of a good Conſcience, may be for inſtruction and direction to the Called Ones of Chriſt; how to preſerve the Conſcience good and peaceable, and ſo to live and dye in the peace and comfort of it, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Get it ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt every day, and under the ſearchings of the Word, and awake unto God, and pure and undefiled, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all the Holy Precepts of God, as binding to your Conſcience; ſo will the Conſcience be tender, and peaceable, and God will witneſs in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences your acceptance with him in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:170425:107"/>I would give out further; ſome Notes of Tryal, Whether you reſt in falſe common grace, or not, as to what we have already ſpoken in ſo weighty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By your <hi>never-ſuſpecting the truth of your grace,</hi> but taking all upon truſt, never doubting but you have Faith, and do repent, and ſo of all the reſt; That ſoul that never ſuſpected his grace, may well fear that his pretended grace, is no more then what a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may reach unto: The poor called Children of God, are exceedingly jealous their Faith is not ſound; that they are ſhort in every grace, becauſe of the woful mixtures that they find, more Unbelief, then Faith; more hardneſs of heart, then ſoftneſs; more pride, then humiliation; and ſo of all. Now that ſoul that goes away with an unſuſpected confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every grace, ſure flatters himſelf, and his way will be found to be deceitful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſoul that draws back his Conſcience from the ſearching power of the Word, when it gives out ways of tryal of ſincerity, and truth of grace, and puts it off, as if not concerned in it; this may well beſpeak a falſe heart. A gracious heart would bring the Work over and over to the Touchſtone of the Word, delivers up it ſelf unto it; yea, is much with God to ſearch him in point of a firm Work upon his Spirit, as to any prevailing iniquity in his heart; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139. When he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, appealing to him, and opening his heart to him, ſpeaks thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Oh Lord thou haſt ſearched me,</hi> &amp;c. thou haſt: And yet <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24. begs of God yet further to ſearch him: <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170425:108"/>
and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me into the way everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Falſe grace is diſcovered by its <hi>eaſie acting:</hi> When you can eaſily believe, eaſily repent, eaſily be humble, and ſo of all others. Certainly, 'tis all naught. There is great contradiction within, and from the Tempter, as to act grace begun in a ſoul; yea, a daily ſupply from Jeſus Chriſt muſt be, to act any grace livelily; which the common pretending eaſie Believers are not ſenſible of. It cannot be but every act of grace muſt find more or leſs reſiſtance from fleſh and bloud, which is ſo vigorouſly oppoſite to the nature and acting of real grace in the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such as are never humbled for the ſpirituall wickedneſſes of their hearts; (I call them ſo in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the more groſs and fleſhly wickedneſſes) now theſe are <hi>hypocriſie, ſelfiſhneſs ſpiritual pride, vain-glory unbelief;</hi> many that have had trouble for ſome groſs ſins, &amp; will withſtand ſome groſs corruptions, through common grace; never come to be abaſed for theſe depths of the heart, which are more hardly diſcerned: I may well enough call that ſoul as yet a Hypocrite, that is never humbled for the Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of his heart, for ſelfiſhneſs, and the reſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Common-grace meaſures the ſoul chiefly by <hi>Negatives,</hi> what it is <hi>not,</hi> rather then what really <hi>it is;</hi> as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. — <hi>I am not as other men are;</hi> pleaſeth himſelf rather in what he is not, then what he is: I am not thus and thus, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of debaucht perſons are; but whether he be called of God, emptyed of his own righteouſneſs, ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and a new Creature in him, he puts off the Examination of.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:170425:108"/>6. Common grace doth at beſt <hi>reſpect a mans ſelf</hi> in all it does, and not the glory of God, which it ſees not; let others be as wicked as they will, it is not much to ſuch a ſoul, let every one look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſuch a ſoul doth not avoid ſin as ſin, but onely for fear it ſhould damn him; whereas the proper nature of grace is to reſpect God, his holineſſe, name and glory.</p>
            <p>Thus have I laid down ſome plain diſcoveries of the pretended New-Creature, that which I have ſtyled a Legall New-Creature. I ſhall now proceed a little further to make diſcovery of a more ſeeming Goſpel New-Creature, yet but ſeeming.</p>
            <p>That which hath the neareſt reſemblance of the New-Creature is, when from ſome <hi>common enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of the Goſpel of grace, and ſome <hi>overly taſtings</hi> of the good word, the <hi>affections</hi> being ſomething ſtirrd therewith, there is ſome affection expreſſed to the Goſpel, and ſome outward reformation upon it, and a profeſſion, above the common formall rate taken up, joyned alſo with <hi>common gifts</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or propheſying, knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all this may make ſo great a <hi>blaze</hi> and flouriſh, that it ſhall be hardly diſcerned, by ſuch a profeſſour himſelf, or others that are ſpirituall; That all this may be, 'tis clear from ſeverall Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4 5. where mention is made of <hi>inlightning, taſting, gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet ſuch to <hi>fall away,</hi> and <hi>never to renew themſelves again;</hi> and <hi>to be nigh unto curſing,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>And</hi> verſe 9. <hi>Beloved we are perſwaded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. Implying, that theſe things may be, but do not alwayes accompany ſalvation; So the Apoſtle
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170425:109"/>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. ſpeaks of ſuch who had <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of Jeſus Christ, and yet again entangled therein, and overcome, and their latter end worſe then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſhall eſcape many groſſe pollutions; and that through a kind of knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet be again overcome, and return wholly to them. So <hi>Math.</hi> 12.45. Our Lord Jeſus ſpeaks of the <hi>houſe ſwept,</hi> and <hi>garniſhed,</hi> the <hi>unclean Spirit caſt out for a time;</hi> ſome outward reformation, a damp upon the luſts of the heart, and knowledge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, and yet the unclean ſpirit returning again.</p>
            <p>Examples might be produced of ſuch profeſſours, in the Goſpell, as that of <hi>Judas,</hi> an eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, a forward follower of Chriſt, ſuffered ſome perſecution, and gifted, and yet proves a Reprobate. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> renounced his ſorceries, took upon him a forward profeſſion of Chriſt, accompanyed <hi>Philip,</hi> and yet <hi>his heart not right in the ſight of God,</hi> Act. 8.13, 21.</p>
            <p>It may be more then feared, This age (to the high ſcandall of Sinners, and Saints) hath produced many ſuch; that have bin much taken with the glorious grace of the Goſpel, their conſciences ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened for Heaven, the affections ſtird, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to flouriſhing gifts, and yet returned to their firſt nothing, turn'd blaſphemers, and profeſſed-<hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt there is ſuch a Majeſty, excellency, ſweetneſſe, in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, that may for a time much affect a carnall heart, and may be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170425:109"/>
received, <hi>with joy, Mat.</hi> 13.20. The very Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt dying for ſinners, may much affect; that he will freely ſave ſinners, the glory he hath provided for his own, theſe and the like things may much take the affections for a time, make a ſoul aſhamed of groſſe pollutions, and yet no New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all this while; And of ſuch as theſe it is, that Chriſt doth Propheſie of, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. who ſhall have Lamps, Light and Profeſſion go along with the wiſe Virgins, wiſe and truly gracious profeſſours, not be diſcovered (many of them) till the Lords appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet kept out of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Now of all others, theſe have the moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a reall New-Creature, and yet fall ſhort, and periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>I ſhould prevent my ſelf, ſhould I at large diſcover wherein ſuch profeſſours are ſhort, onely a word or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such ſouls are never emptyed of themſelves, and humble &amp; ſo come poor and nothing to Jeſus Chriſt, though hapdly they may be able to ſpeak of it, as many ſouls have a forme of Goſpel-knowledge, and can ſay, <hi>we are nothing,</hi> and yet never had the ſaving experience of it upon their own hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such ſouls have no <hi>true brokenneſs of heart for ſin,</hi> they much ſlight it; yea, ſay many, tis Legall; broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ſin, is a low diſpenſation, as they will ſtyle it; without which (in ſome meaſure) no ſaving repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is as neceſſary to ſalvation, as believing of Jeſus Chriſt, and Free-grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though ſuch ſouls may reforme many things, yet there is ſome <hi>unſubdued luſt</hi> in the heart, that at

laſt breaks out, and carryes an end the heart, as with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Demas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Under all ſuch enlightenings and taſtings which may for a time affect the heart, the heart ſtill remaines <hi>unchanged;</hi> and ſo no New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>What hath bin ſpoken as to this may put the more forward profeſſours upon a cloſe and diligent ſearch, and to ſee if their attainments in enlighning, taſting, knowledge, gifts, reformation, be no more then what a Reprobate may attain to: and to lay their hearts under the ſearching power of the word, and to open their hearts to God, and cry unto him, and keep a godly jealouſie over their Spirits; And reſt not till you get poor and emptyed and humble your ſelves, your hearts broken for ſin, every luſt ſubdued and crucified, the heart changed, and your ſouls rooted into Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſaving union with him; yea to give up your hearts to what we ſhall further ſay, through grace, as to the plain opening the reall Goſpel New-Creature.</p>

               <head>The Goſpel New-Creature, poſitively opened.</head>
               <p>I Might here ſhew you how every faculty of the ſoul is <hi>renewed,</hi> As the underſtanding, by the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new and divine light into it, which is ſtyled the <hi>Enlightening the eyes of the underſtanding,</hi> Epheſ. 1.18. and to be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of the mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. How the will is altered and changed, the affections made new, the conſcience purged and ſanctified, with all the powers of the ſoul: but I ſhall not take this Method, but rather purſue a more familiar way, more particularly ſhewing the make of the New-Creature, in reference ſtill to its being ſo in Chriſt, which is our principall ſcope. Firſt, then;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the making and framing the <hi>New Creature,</hi> there muſt be a <hi>New-Nature;</hi> If there be a New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formed, there muſt be a <hi>New-Nature</hi> to make it ſo; hence believers that are in Chriſt, are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Which is wrought, by <hi>the incorruptible ſeed of the word,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. Whereby we are ſaid to be <hi>born again,</hi> And <hi>I am.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Of his will, own will, begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſeed, is the ſeed of God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the ſeed of every grace in the ſoul, which is ſomething of the likeneſſe of God wrought in the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170425:111"/>
ſoul, and ſo acts the ſoul towards God; which is ſtyled the infuſed habits of every grace in the ſoul; this New-Nature works contrary to the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and it is ſtyled, The regenerate part, <hi>the new inward man, Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. and aſſoon as it is wrought and formed in the ſoul, it works againſt the ſinfull diſpoſitions of the old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, and there is a new war or conflict begun within us, (which is ſomething more then the reſiſtance of a naturall conſcience as we have ſhewed) <hi>I ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Law in my members, warring againſt the Law of my mind,</hi> Rom. 7.23. <hi>&amp;c. The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrary to each others</hi> Gal. 5.17. And under this daily conflict and war within, is every New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while we abide in the fleſhly tabernacle. This is the firſt peculiar diſtinguiſhing Workmanſhip of the New-Creature, there's a new ſeed, a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature infuſed into the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is a New-Nature, ſo it followes that this New-Creature hath a <hi>new life,</hi> it is a <hi>Living</hi> New-Creature; ſo regenerate perſons are ſaid to be <hi>quicken'd in Chriſt,</hi> who were before <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> Eph. 2.1, 5. And, <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and live, John</hi> 5. And they are ſaid to <hi>be, Alive unto God,</hi> Rom. 6.11. <hi>Christ liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Which new life muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every naturall man, (as hath bin already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is dead in ſin, and is ſaid to be <hi>without this life of God,</hi> Eph. 4.18. The Life of God departed from the ſoul, whereby it had Communion with God, upon our fall in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore, if we are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170425:111"/>
recovered, we muſt have a new Life from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be not a <hi>new life</hi> breathed in us, we can put forth no ſpiritual vigour in any duty towards God, and ſo all our duties, ſervices, worſhip would be dead fleſhly duties; this I have alſo hinted in ſhewing the neceſſity of being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> if a New-Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As there is a new nature, and a new life, to begin the New-Creature; ſo, thence there's <hi>anew breathing;</hi> The Soul falls a breathing after God, and after Jeſus Chriſt; As the life which God breath'd into man at his firſt Creation, is call'd the <hi>breath of life,</hi> Gen. 2.7. And aſſoon as ever there is life, this new life breath'd by the Holy Ghoſt in the New-Creature, there's preſently a <hi>breathing</hi> of this life, as indeed one of the firſt diſcoveries of it, (as breath is the moſt immediate acting of Life) the ſoul <hi>breathes,</hi> and <hi>pants,</hi> and cryes after God himſelf, Pſal. 42.1. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brookes, ſo pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my ſoul after thee, Oh</hi> God; <hi>I opened my mouth, and panted, Pſal.</hi> 119.131. So that prayer, that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it is <hi>the breath of a living</hi> ſoul; <hi>Paul</hi> that breath'd out cruelties againſt the Saints, when converted, and made Alive, he falls a breathing after God; <hi>Acts</hi> 9.— <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi> And this doth indeed ariſe from the very nature of ſaving grace, which is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſoul to God through Jeſus Chriſt, to ſet it a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only after mercy, and pardon, and peace, but after God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>My ſoul is a thirſt for God, the living God,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo from the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and emptineſſe the ſoul begins to find in all Creature-enjoyments, which now it cannot (having
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170425:112"/>
had a view of Chriſt) be ſatisfied and contented with, but the ſoul muſt have God, muſt have Jeſus Chriſt, muſt have the likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it breathes, cryes, pants after God, and the poſſeſſion of him, and communion with him, as the Souls higheſt perfection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now, therefore, before I go any further, let this be well-weighed: Have you this <hi>breathing</hi> in you, which when you were dead in ſin, you had not. This is the leaſt degree of grace, if the ſoul be not thus breathing, panting, thirſting, longing after Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that you cannot, muſt not, be ſatisfied, but in the enjoyment of him; verily you are dead, and the grace of God is not in you: ſo that it may be for a true diſcovery of your ſtates. Conſider, what your hearts do moſt breathe after, what they moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pant for: Oh! Is it for Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? The hearts of Carnal Worldlings are ſaid <hi>to pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the duſt of the Earth, Amos</hi> 2.7. that is it the carnal mans heart thirſts after: but a Soul in Chriſt breathes upward, the Treaſures of Heaven it pants after, and will never be at reſt, till ſatisfied with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may ſerve to diſtinguiſh formal praying, from that which is of the Spirit in the Children of God. There's no ſuch thing as the breathing, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, crying, longing of the Soul after God, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Communion with him, in formal <hi>ſaying</hi> of prayers: the thing done, quiets the Conſcience; but for God himſelf, the Soul thirſts not for: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that pray in forms in ſecret, and content your ſelves, in ſaying and repeating ſuch a form of words, ſure you have little or no breathing for Jeſus
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170425:112"/>
Chriſt in ſuch Duties, the Heart is not exerciſed in longings and pantings for God: ye Souls, that pray out of forms, upon terrors, and no more upon the Conſcience, but you thirſt not, breathe nor after God himſelf, you may be ſhort of the life of God in you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This may alſo encourage weak Souls, that have but broken words, to expreſs themſelves to God, yet your very Souls do breathe and pant after the Lord: verily the life of Chriſt is in you, if it be indeed ſo with you, and God will hear thoſe brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in you, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.56. <hi>Hide not thine Ear at my breathings.</hi> The bleſſed God will not hide his Ear from the breathings of his poor Children.</p>
               <p>Onely let crying-panting Souls take heed, that this breath be not ſtopt nor intermitted: 'tis a moſt dangerous thing to intermit the breath of Prayer, that it grows weaker and fainter, it will be a ſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and a ſad one too, that the New-Creature is rather decaying, then increaſing in you.</p>
               <p>Be not contented with no more praying, then will juſt, as we ſay, hold Life and Soul together; that's to live at a very low rate; but juſt to live, if that. As breathing takes in the Air, revives, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Natural Spirits, renders the whole man lively, and lightſome, and vigorous; ſo doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Spiritual breathing with God, and after God; it enlargeth the Heart, revives the Soul, keeps freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigour of Spirit in the way of God, when God comes in with a full gale upon the ſoul, how ſweetly is it refreſhed, how doth faintneſs, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indiſpoſition, go off, and the Spirit of a poor Creature is chearful with God, and bleſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170425:113"/>
it ſelf in him. Oh delight to be every where in every way, where God breathes upon the hearts of his people, and where they breathe after him.</p>
               <p>And let new living Souls take heed, by the way, how their Hearts do pant after the Earth and World, and the Contentments of it: this will as much damp Spiritual Life, and breath in the Soul, as any evil whatſoever: Lay your hearts to the fulneſs and ſweetneſses of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and breathe ſtrongly for them, and thoſe things will be but wind and vanity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But I muſt proceed: I come now to ſpeak of the next Diſcovery of the New-Creature, and that is, it hath <hi>new ſenſes;</hi> That you may ſee how fully it anſwers the frame of man, as a Living-Creature, and what a New Creation this is: As the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a new Nature, a new inward life, and hath a new breathing, ſo it hath new Spiritual Senſes: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. ſpeaks of the <hi>Exerciſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Senſes.</hi> And as the Natural Life is exerciſed and preſerved by Senſes, ſo is alſo this new Spirituall Life of the New Creature, which I ſhall mention particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a <hi>New Ear</hi> given to this New Creature: This Jeſus Chriſt hath frequently promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he would <hi>open the Deaf Ear:</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 36.10. <hi>He openeth alſo their Ear to Diſcipline, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that they return from iniquity. The hearing Ear, and the ſeeing Eye, the Lord hath made even both of them,</hi> Prov. 20.12. By this opening the Ear, is meant the opening of the Heart; as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened:</hi> The heart is ſhut up naturally, and naturally cannot hear the <hi>voice of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170425:113"/>
Spirit,</hi> till the Lord himſelf open it. A natural man hears no more then the voice of a man, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word: but when this New Creature is formed, he is enabled to hear the voice of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the voice of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice.</hi> A Soul can then ſay, This the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>me</hi> in ſpecial: This is the voice of Chriſt that calls <hi>me,</hi> to come to him, and that Soul comes; Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks with a convincing, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, powerful Word, and the Heart being opened to receive it, obeys it as <hi>his</hi> voice: And ſo in every Ordinance, 'tis the Voice of the Spirit of Chriſt the New-Creature waits for; <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> Rev. 3. laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The New Creature hath a <hi>new ſeeing eye:</hi> The eyes of the Underſtanding opened, to ſee into the bleſſed and hidden myſteries of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle of the Natural man, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. And, <hi>ſeeing they ſee not, Math.</hi> 13.13. But Chriſt ſpeaking of called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee,</hi> &amp;c. They have a new ſight of God in Jeſus Chriſt, which ſight doth <hi>abaſe</hi> them, and alſo <hi>draw</hi> them to Jeſus Chriſt. The Vail being in part taken away, they can look into the things of God which they ſaw not before, the Scriptures begin to be unveiled, and they ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Letter of them, into the Life and Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them. And thus the Lord Jeſus promiſed of old, ſpecially as to new Teſtament-days, <hi>I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known, I will make darkneſſe light before them, and crooked things ſtraight.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:170425:114"/>Thirdly, There is a <hi>new power of Taſting</hi> given to the Soul, as another <hi>Spiritual Senſe,</hi> which before the Soul had not to purpoſe. A new and bleſſed taſting of the good Word of Life, <hi>Thy Word is ſweeter then the Honey-Combe,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. there's a <hi>new taſte</hi> of the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of ſin; <hi>The heart knows its own bitterneſs,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man: A <hi>taſting</hi> of the ſpecial, free, and precious love of Chriſt: A <hi>taſting</hi> of the goodneſs of God in mercies. And thus there is a <hi>ſavoury ſpirit</hi> given to the New Creature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth delightfully ſavour the things of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and can ſpeak ſavourily of them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Adde to this a <hi>new Smelling,</hi> to which the Spouſe of Chriſt often alludes in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Song, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Cintments,</hi> Chap. 1.3. ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, who is as a new and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfume to the Soul; <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſs perfumed with Myrrhe and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> Chap. 3.6. So ſaith that Word of Promiſe, Chap. 4.6. — <hi>His ſmell ſhall be as Lebanon:</hi> And when Jeſus Chriſt breathes in his Ordinances upon bleſſed Souls, it is as a ſweet and delightſome Perfume to them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is a <hi>new feeling</hi> wrought as an effect of this new life, which the Soul hath in Chriſt, when a new Creature is in him. The natural man is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling,</hi> as a dead man is; let never ſo great a weight lye on a dead man, and he feels not: but now take a Soul created into Chriſt, and he feels a new <hi>Weight</hi> within him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Sin is not onely
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170425:114"/>
a burden, as to the weight of guilt, but every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (even when the ſenſe of guilt is removed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) is a <hi>Weight</hi> to the Soul, under which the Soul cryes out, mourns, groans to be delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death?</hi> Sin hangs like a dead body about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the Goſpel-new-creature is a <hi>living</hi> new creature, and doth exerciſe <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life, and hath <hi>new ſpiritual ſenſes:</hi> Let this then be a word of Tryal to diſcover the ſtate of your Souls. Can you ſay I that was dead, am alive? I was once ſpiritually dead, without feeling; did neither ſee, nor hear, nor taſte, in a Spiritual way; but now the Lord, in rich grace, hath opened my deaf Ear, and my blind Eyes, now I have heard the Lord himſelf ſpeak to my ſoul; now I have ſeen the Lord, and my Heart is taken with him: Now I ſavour the Word of Grace, and the Miniſtration of the Goſpel is a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt to me: the Name of Jeſus Chriſt is as <hi>good Ointment</hi> to me: Now I feel a body of ſin, and groan under it, and preſs after the deſtroying and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Souls, If this be not your Experience, you are dead: you are without the Life of God, and Chriſt in you.</p>
               <p>Oh! go to God, ſinners, as you have been exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cry to him to <hi>open</hi> your ear to hear, and your eye to ſee: Be convinced, that as yet your Ear hath been ſtopt, as to hearing the Lord himſelf ſpeak to you. Oh ſay, Woe is me that I am where the Lord uſeth to ſpeak, under the Miniſtration of his Goſpel, and yet he never ſpake to my Soul. Doth the Lord love me, and never ſpeak to me?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:170425:115"/>Pity, Lord, Pity a poor deaf, blind, ſtupid, unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wretch, and breathe life into me: And then wait for the Lord's Voice in his Word, Now let the Spirit himſelf ſpeak unto me, and unveil my heart, that I may ſee into the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, and may ſavour them upon my poor Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let living Souls in Chriſt, <hi>exerciſe</hi> their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſes, keep the Ear <hi>open</hi> to, and waiting for, the Spirits Voice: be prying into the myſtery of God in Chriſt, and all Goſpel-Truths, get a clearer ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, till you ſhall be infinitely taken with him, and love him for himſelf: And keep the heart ſavoury, and the precious ſcent of Goſpel-grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Spirits, and labour ſo to feel the weight of the body of ſin, how it poyſeth, polluteth, cloudeth the Soul, that you may come to that frame, to cry out to be delivered from it. And let it be abundant matter of praiſe to the riches of grace, that God hath given life and ſenſes to your ſouls, which he might have left under the death of ſin, to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next Diſcovery of our Goſpel New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is this; namely, He hath a <hi>new heart.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> chap. 18.31.— <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> which the Lord hath in Free-grace promiſed in the New-covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you:</hi> which I ſhall preciſely conſider, and ſhew particularly, wherein the heart is made new.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heart naturally, in its old corrupt frame, is a <hi>rebellious heart,</hi> Jer. 5.23. <hi>This people have a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious heart;</hi> the uſual complaint of the Prophets. Now when the Lord makes the heart new, he begins to take away the <hi>rebellion</hi> of heart, as it naturally
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170425:115"/>
oppoſeth the Word, Power, and Spirit of God, and the heart is made obedient and plyable to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Word, the Spirit's Teachings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land; but, if ye refuſe and rebel ye ſhall be devoured,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My people ſhall be willing in the day of my power,</hi> Pſal. 110. The heart, of it ſelf, is ſtubborn, obſtinate, unwilling to ſtoop to the power of Truth, to yield to Jeſus Chriſt: but when it is made new, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of an yieldable frame, to the practical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Goſpel-Truths.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The heart as an effect of the former, is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impenitent, Rom.</hi> 2.5. cannot mourn for ſinne: But When 'tis made new, God makes it ſoft, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you a heart of fleſh;</hi> which is a ſoft and tender heart, whereby a Soul can pour out its complaints to God: yea, the <hi>heart will pour out it ſelf like water to the Lord,</hi> Lam. 2.19. The Heart receives impreſſions of truth, as by its ſoftneſs 'tis more and more wrought to a new frame, as in the hand of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Heart is naturally <hi>proud,</hi> and makes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> and well-opinioned of his own condition, and will not ſuffer the ſinner to abaſe himſelf to God, and to take ſhame to himſelf: But, when a new Work of God's upon it, the ſinner hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf under the mighty hand of God, bears his reproach before him, and cryes out, Oh! What ſhall I do for an humble heart? Lord, take away ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Pride in a wretched creature, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.10. Now he becomes a poor ſelf-emptyed creature, undone, helpleſs; and to a full Chriſt he at laſt goes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:170425:116"/>4. The Heart is naturally <hi>hypocritical: The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in heart heaps up wrath,</hi> Job 36.13. Now when God makes the heart new, then it begins to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> in ſome good meaſure, for God: before the poor deceived ſinner, thought he did all with a good heart; that he did bear much upon, that he did all with a good heart: but when God ſhews him his heart, by the Candle of his Word and Spirit, then the poor Creature ſees what a Hell of Hypocriſie was, and is, within him; that he acted in all Duties, as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo to himſelf, and not uprightly unto God: But when the Lord new frames the heart, then the Soul is after new, ſincere, holy aims for God in all it does, is moſt abaſed for ſelfiſh and hypocritical mixtures, and would account nothing well done, but as God is deſigned in it, and labours to walk in <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of heart, and <hi>godly ſincerity, as of God, and in the ſight of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The old Heart is full of all <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,</hi> and cares not to be cleanſed: So ſaith Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Within you are full of dead mens bones, (rottenneſs) and of all uncleanneſs.</hi> But now when the new creature is forming up, then the Heart is after purifying; <hi>Purifie your hearts, ye dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded,</hi> Jam. 4.8. Then, what a bleſſedneſs would a pure heart be, ſaith a poor Creature? Oh! that my heart were cleanſed! <hi>Waſh thine heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>God, Jer.</hi> 4.14. Oh! that it were waſhed, ſaith the new creature. And this is one of the moſt ſpecial Works a new Creature will be after, as he is more formed up in Holineſs, to keep the Heart pure, as a Temple for God.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:170425:116"/>
               <p n="6">6. The Heart naturally is <hi>dead,</hi> as already hinted, and <hi>feels</hi> not its own <hi>deadneſs:</hi> but when renewed, then the <hi>heart doth live that ſeeks</hi> God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. It feels, and mourns over its own deadneſs, and cries out, Quicken, Oh quicken me, oh God! No Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is well performed then, but as the Heart lives, in ſome meaſure, in that Duty. Now it feels its own burdens, pollutions, luſts, corruptions, carnality, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and bewails it before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Heart is naturally divided between Chriſt and the World, Chriſt and Luſts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is divided:</hi> But under its renewings, the heart, as to the main bent of it, makes a <hi>whole</hi> cloſe with Chriſt; the great buſineſs of a ſoul then is, to give the whole heart up to Chriſt, and fears he can never do it fully and ſingly enough; and when the heart luſteth after other things, ſo far as it is renewed, it is fetcht in again to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Heart of it ſelf is <hi>unbelieving:</hi> Take heed <hi>leaſt there be in you a heart of unbelief,</hi> Hebr. 3. Now when the heart is made new, there is a <hi>Work of Faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.11. And then the ſoul is made ſenſible of that bitter Root of Unbelief, that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their hearts, and they finde it the hardeſt work in the world, to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, to fix on Promiſes; And that a believing heart is a ſpecial gift of God, and a work of the Spirit; which while a poor ſinner was ſhut up under Unbelief he felt not.</p>

the Lord, and wilfull obſtinacy againſt his Word and Spirit; and therefore 'tis, that you caſt the Word of the Lord from you, and in your hearts deſpiſe it, and ſay, This is not the Word of the Lord, and we will not obey it: You have hard and impenitent hearts, and therefore you do not mourn for ſin: you have proud hearts, and are well conceited of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though damnable; and therefore you do not humble your ſelves to God: you have hypocritiall hearts, and ſee it not, full of a Hell of Uncleanneſs, dead in ſin, and without feeling, the heart divided between Chriſt and the World, unbelieving, and yet ſay, you have Faith: If thou canſt not make out a newneſs upon thy heart, as we have ſhew'd, thou haſt ſtill thine old heart, with its Luſts, and thy eſtate is as yet damnable, let thy knowledge, profeſſion, outward blameleſsneſs, be what it will.</p>

Can you ſay to the praiſe of free and rich grace, that God hath, in ſome meaſure, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away your <hi>Rebellious Heart</hi> from you, and you can ſtoop and yield to the power of Truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, that God hath made your heart ſoft in ſome meaſure, and the pride of your hearts, in the falſe conceit you had of your ſelves, hath a ſtroak from God upon it, that God hath ſhewed you your deep and curſed hypocriſie, and how your heart was divided, and was wholly unbelieving; And that the Remnants of theſe wickedneſſes in you, of heart-rebellion hardneſs, pride, hypocriſie, pollution, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, are your greateſt burden, and you mourn over them daily.</p>

Therefore, let it convince you, and exhort you to go, and fall down before the Lord, and beg him to open your hearts (which naturally are ſhut up in darkneſs) and to abaſe you in the ſenſe of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and that he would even do this for you in much mercy, to take away a rebellious, hard, proud heart from you, and would make your hearts pliable to the Word, make them ſoft and humble before him, and to cloſe, with the whole heart, with Jeſus Chriſt, through a work of Faith upon you.

               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:170425:118"/>Love therefore a ſearching Word from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt that are over you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The next Diſcovery of the Goſpel New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this; namely, <hi>The Goſpel New-Creature hath new affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly to inſtance in ſome of the chief.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The New-Creature hath <hi>new fear:</hi> The fear of an Eternal Condition, that firſt uſually ſeizeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a convinced ſinner; the fear of a juſt and angry God againſt ſin; and, at laſt, upon its renewing, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awful fear of God, as great, and holy, and good; a fear of ſinning againſt him, and that becauſe he is gracious: Naturally this affection of fear in a Carnal heart, is converſant about the loſs of outward things, about ſhame in the World, and the like: and ſo far as it reſpects God, his Soul, 'tis a ſlaviſh fear, of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of ſome groſſer ſins onely, leaſt God ſhould damn him: but not fearing the Lord with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Son-like fear, a fear that purifies the Heart, a fear that is mixt with a bleſſed <hi>love</hi> of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his ways.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Heart is exerciſed with <hi>new ſorrow:</hi> A godly ſorrowing for ſin, ſuch ſins which were once the delight of the Heart; ſuch a ſorrowing, that works an <hi>indignation</hi> againſt the Darling-ſins, a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a kind of <hi>Revenge</hi> of our ſelves for it, a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>deſire</hi> after pleaſing of God, and Holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. There is a ſorrowing over a crucified Chriſt, and a ſorrowing after him: And well is a poor Soul, when it can go in ſecret, and have this affection moſt exerciſed, with ſighs, and groans, and tears, and ſad complaints againſt it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:170425:118"/>3. There is a <hi>new joy</hi> by degrees inſtilled in the Soul, of which though there are various meaſures, to the Children of God, yet every New-Creature can go thus far, though not in that vigour of Spirit he would do, that (when the Spirit is free from great diſtemper) it can ſay, he hath ſome joy that he is deliver'd from the dominion and thraldome of luſts, that 'tis its joy to go before God; <hi>I will go unto God, my exceeding joy,</hi> Pſal. 43.4. Even when under ſome diſquietneſs of ſpirit; as verſe 2. <hi>why doeſt thou cast me off?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, will a poor ſoul ſay, God and Communion with him, (could I ſee his face) would be my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt joy. And the carnall joy of the heart, when it breaks forth, leaves the ſoul but more in heavineſſe, and the New-Creature would have his joy run ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon this the New-Creature hath <hi>New de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;</hi> The word of God becomes his delight, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the face of God, and the people of <hi>God; Delight thy ſelf in God</hi> Pſal. 37. And <hi>his chief delight is in the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. The heart cannot, as it could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, delight it ſelf in folly, and in vanity, and in vain carnall wayes and people, but is rather bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Soul is raiſed and engaged <hi>in a new Love;</hi> The heart is taken with Jeſus Chriſt above all things, and Loves Him moſt; and Loves God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Holy, Loves his word, and Loves thoſe that Love him moſt; Every New-Creature can ſay, as <hi>David,</hi> I Love the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. &amp; 116.1. Yea the ſoul is brought to Love Jeſus Chriſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, He is the Beloved of the Soul, and not onely
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170425:119"/>
the grace, and peace, and bleſſing, and heaven that he gives. And to Love Jeſus Chriſt, and to expreſſe it to the utmoſt, is the frame of ſoul that a convert preſſeth moſt after, and he would get the heart more purged, mortified, ſpiritualized, that it might go forth in Love to Chriſt more ſtrongly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and enjoy the precious perfumes of his Love more conſtantly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Soul is raiſed to a <hi>new hope;</hi> A new hope of Heaven and Glory, which before was feigned and deceitful; Now the ſoul is after a well bottom'd, reall, lively, hope of Heaven; <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! the new and bleſſed hopes that a ſoul doth more and more reach to, (when diſtemper and darkneſſe is not upon it) of ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt as he is, Living with Him for ever, of being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinleſſe and holy, of joyes that ſhall be endleſſe, of being ſwallowed up with divine glory, when the ſpirit of the Father doth breathe moſt ſweetly, and moſtly raiſes the heart to glimpſes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> As we go along, we would put things to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; therefore ſay, in good earneſt, Soul, Haſt thou had new fears upon thy Soul, as to an eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? and is the fear of ſin, and of the living God upon thy heart? and doth this fear keep thy heart owfull and watchfull? ſay, Haſt thou had new ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for ſin, and 'tis thy trouble they are no more abundant? Canſt thou joy in going to God, and in the word of his grace, and are ſpirituall things thy delight? Doeſt thou find a heart-cloſing Love
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170425:119"/>
to Jeſus Chriſt above all, and canſt thou Love God, becauſe he is holly, and thou wouldſt be like unto him; and haſt thou new experienc'd of hopes Heaven?</p>
               <p>Say ſoul, Do all thy affections run in a <hi>new channell,</hi> and the ſtream of them, in the main, turned from world and vanity, to the Ocean of God in Chriſt, his fulneſſe, goodneſſe, love, grace, and glory? and that when thy affections, or any one of them are diverted, and turned aſide, thou canſt and doeſt go to God to have them fetcht in again, and thou wouldſt have all the affections of thy Soul run freely, clearly, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, fully, ſtrongly upon Jeſus Chriſt? and thou art humbled, that they are carnall and worldly in any meaſure?</p>
               <p>If this be not thy caſe, but the affections of thy heart are wholly fleſhly &amp; worldly; thy fears, thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are about worldly things; thy joyes, thy delights about carnall pleaſures, and worldly encreaſe, thy Love goeth after the world in an interrupted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified courſe, thy hopes going forth about great things for thy ſelf, and thy hopes for Heaven, lye at all uncertainly, and thou doeſt ſuffer it to be ſo; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, thou art unchanged, and haſt no part as yet in New-Creature bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Onely let me add this Caution, that in this matter of the New-Creature, you take the whole frame together; And therefore do not reſt <hi>onely</hi> in this, that you have had your <hi>affections</hi> ſomething ſtirred in hearing the Goſpel, ſome fears, and ſometimes the heart a little melted, and ſome joy, for a time in the world; which affections may ſometime ſtirr in a ſoul, whoſe heart is not ſubdued and changed, and ſo it weares off again, but carry your ſelves back
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170425:120"/>
to what I have ſaid, that you mainly look to the Rebellion, Pollution, Hypocriſie, Unbelief of the heart; that theſe be in good earneſt, ſtill a ſubduing in you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo alſo for reall Converts, though you ſhould labour to preſerve your affections, lively, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, yet look moſtly to the ſincerity and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of them, or elſe when they wax faint again, (as that may be,) you be at a great loſſe of your conſolation; neither do you alwayes meaſure your ſelves by the ſtirring and overflow of affections, but rather by the abaſement of your ſpirits, hearts, purity, and ſincerity, and the holineſſe of your affections, and your acting faith, in all your duties, which will procure a more laſting way of peace and Comfort; though when thus rectified, the going out of ſtrong and tender affections is exceeding ſweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and moſt deſireable by all Saints.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) The next diſcovery of the New-Creature is this, (which I may conſider with ſome diſtinction from the former); <hi>The Goſpel New-Creature hath new thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>thoughts</hi> I underſtand the pondering, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part of the mind, (that I may ſpeak plainly to all,) The imaginations, fancies, purpoſes, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, muſings, of the mind of man, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much alter'd, where there is a <hi>new</hi> and divine work and power in the Soul.</p>
               <p>To this the Prophet ſpeakes, as to ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Eſay 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So that a Soul return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord, forſakes his vile thoughts, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170425:120"/>
doth not give way to them, and feed them as before. So, <hi>Jer..</hi> 4.14. How long <hi>ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> And Pſal. 119.113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhew a little, why the thoughts of the heart ſhall be changed, and then more particularly, how.</p>
               <p>In a naturall heart, <hi>All the imaginations of it are evil continually,</hi> Gen. 5.6. <hi>They became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Rom. 1.21. Where the thoughts, as iſſues of the luſts, do rove to and fro at full liberty, without any effectuall controle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As firſt, <hi>Atheiſticall thoughts;</hi> ſecretly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, his Juſtice, Holineſſe, Word, or that God will not Judge ſinners according to the rigour of his word; <hi>Thou thoughteſt</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch a one as thy ſelf,</hi> and, Pſal. 50.21. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no</hi> God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. For when he ſins againſt him preſumptuouſly, he doth ſtrike at his very Being, Juſtice, and Holineſſe, and either ſaith in his heart, There is no God to Judge him, or ſecretly wiſheth there were none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Profane thoughts,</hi> according to the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant luſtings of the heart, do act a naturall heart; As vain, unclean, proud, worldly thoughts, which are in contrivance to <hi>make proviſion for the lusts</hi> of it, the heart even continually exercis'd with unclean, proud, wrathfull, revengefull, or covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſes; therefore, ſaith the wiſdom of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The thoughts of the wicked are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord; Out of the heart proceed evil
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170425:121"/>
thoughts, Adulteries, Murderers, Thefts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. The evil thoughts get up and act over wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and then they purpoſe and contrive for the acting of it, and ſet the whole man on work to make proviſion and to effect it; which thoughts being drawn forth by ſinfull objects, or the working of the fancy, and the devil working by both, do break forth into abominable practiſes, unleſſe reſtrained by the Lord; for indeed the fancy, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty is the very forge of the devil, where he frames all the wickedneſſes, that is brought forth.</p>
               <p>Now theſe being the naturall actings of the thoughts of the heart as unchanged, there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enſue a New working of thoughts upon the change of it.</p>
               <p>Onely obſerve by the way, by this any ſinner may know how it ſtands with his ſoul; If Atheiſticall, profane, unclean, worldly thoughts, carry the heart an end, and rove up and down at liberty, and the heart even delightfully feeds them, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and mourning over them, for their purging and mortifying, and no, or but an unwilling reſiſtance of them; how dwelleth then the grace of God in thee? verily not at all; And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon thy ſelf, for by this thou mayſt know the ſtate of thy heart, and thy luſts are yet in their ſtrength, and rule in thee, and will poſt thee to Hell, if the Lord meet not with thee.</p>
               <p>A gracious heart hath bubling up of ſuch thoughts, and the devil caſts in ſuggeſtions to ſet them a work, but they lodge not there long, but they are reſiſted nd purged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:170425:121"/>Take therefore theſe notes of a carnall unchanged heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such a ſoul maks little or no conſcience of thoughts, Thoughts are free, ſay wretched ſouls, but that's a proverb ſuggeſted by the Devil. (2.) Such a ſoul is not humbled, doth not mourn for wicked thoughts, but only looks to the outward man a little. (3.) Such a ſoul doth not bring them to the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to be purged. (4.) He doth not conflict with them; reſiſt, check, hate them. (5.) He doth not watch the thoughts of the heart, nor labour to ſet them upon holy objects; If it be thus with thee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thy heart works wickedneſſe, and thou art loathſome in the ſight of the holy God, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and obſerveth all thy thoughts afarre off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. I will one day reckon with thee for them; what doeſt thou but even deny God to be the great ſearcher of hearts, the All-ſeeing God, who careſt not how vain, vile, wicked, unclean, profane, loathſome, deviliſh the thoughts of thy heart are?</p>
               <p>But wherein doth this news of thoughts ſhew it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The New-Creatures thoughts are changed, as to himſelf; who thought well of himſelf; as to Heaven and happineſſe before, but now ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vile, and hath worſe thoughts, of himſelf, then any one in the world can have of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>new thoughts of</hi> God; New thoughts of his Holinſse, and Juſtice, and Greatneſs, &amp; Glory; Oh! how great is God, how Holy, how Juſt! &amp; ſo is greatly abaſed before him. He hath new thoughts of his goodneſſe, grace, and love to poor Sinners, upon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170425:122"/>
which the thoughts do much work, thoughts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and praiſe; and the ſoul delights in holy and gracious muſings of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath <hi>New Thoughts</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, of his Perſon, Grace, Bloud, Righteouſneſs, Spirit, Word, People. Before he had poor, low, empty, carnal, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Thoughts of Chriſt: but the heart being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the Mind enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, the Thoughts work towards Jeſus Chriſt, the Soul hath deep and ſerious thoughts of his grace and love, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thoughts of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He hath <hi>new thoughts of Eternity;</hi> of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition which muſt poſſeſs the Heart, what may become of his Soul: What will it profit to gain the World, and loſe his Soul? How he may treaſure up for Heaven, make ſure work for Heaven, what ever be his condition in this world: and the ſerious and frequent thoughts of this, do much poiz the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Believer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He hath new thoughts of the ways of God, and Holineſs, before he thought baſely or notionally of them, now he hath <hi>real</hi> thoughts of Holineſs, and of the ways of Jeſus Chriſt, he doth believe, and finds a reality in them, and hath good thoughts of them, as to engage his Soul to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He hath <hi>New Thoughts</hi> of Holy People, whom before he eſteemed Hypocrites, and Phariſees, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the like; That their ſtrictneſs was their Pride and Hypocriſie; but now he honoureth them moſt, is humbled greatly for ſuch thoughts of them, and prizeth them as the Excellent of the Earth, and their company will be moſt deſirable, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.</p>

To ſinners, that you do go to God, and get your hearts poſſeſſed with ſuch thoughts of God as theſe are: How great, how juſt, how holy he is! and this will make you tremble at going on in your pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions any more. <hi>Bethink</hi> your ſelves of the ſtate of your ſouls, and of an eternal condition: ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.59. Bethink your ſelves how ſhort a time it is e're an eternal condition ſhall paſs upon you, and how long the bleſſed God hath wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be gracious to you; and get new thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, and get to his feet, and make a reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſelves to him; and then your thoughts will go after more excellent and ſoul-quieting, and ſoul delighting Objects, then hitherto you have bin exerciſed with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſuch as are new Creatures in Chriſt, and have <hi>New Thoughts</hi> of themſelves, of God, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Holineſs, greatneſs, graciouſneſs, of Chriſt, of Eternity, of the ways and people of the Lord, let this be a word of Exhortation to you, to look to your Thoughts: ſaith the Wiſdome of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. <hi>As he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he.</hi> A Soul is before the Lord, according to the thoughts of his heart. Oh take heed of giving way to and feeding vain unclean, unholy Thoughts of any kind: and let me preſs it upon you with theſe Motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that <hi>ſuch thoughts are your ſins,</hi> lay that to heart. God may juſtly damn a Soul for unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thoughts; Know thou mayſt commit Adultery, or Murder in thy Heart, though it break not forth actually. <hi>If thou haſt done fooliſhly, in lifting up thy ſelf, or if thou haſt thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170425:123"/>
mouth,</hi> Prov. 30.32. This will help to keep thy Heart in awe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God's Eye is ſtrictly and continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Thoughts of thine Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2. and therefore <hi>David</hi> cryes out to God, to ſearch his Heart for them. Oh did a gracious Soul ſtill conſider this, that the jealous Eye of God is upon every Thought and Motion of his Heart to ſinne, it would make him look cloſely to the Thoughts of his Heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that evil Thoughts and Muſings of ſin are the beginning of all open wickedneſs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Then when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſinne,</hi> and ſuch Thoughts are uſually ſet on fire by the Devil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They do defile the ſoul,</hi> Mat. 15.20. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe are the things which defile a man:</hi> Which defilement unfits the ſoul for communion with God; they make a filthy pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the ſoul: and what a caſe is a poor Creature in, to come to God, in Duty, in ſuch a pickle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Evil Thoughts do <hi>pervert the Heart</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> which ſhould be <hi>fixed</hi> upon him; they draw away the ſtrength of the Heart from God; they ſuck up the juice and marrow of the Heart, which ſhould be ſpent in Spiritual things in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such Thoughts do <hi>grieve the Spirit:</hi> Nothing more; the Spirit cannot delight to teach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when the Heart is moſtly acted by fooliſh and unholy Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When ſuch Thoughts are acted in the Soul, God may <hi>leave you to the power of them,</hi> to break out to ſome grievous fall, and ſo may ſhipwrack your
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170425:123"/>
peace and comforts for a great while, and go with broken bones, and it may coſt you much bitterneſs, before you are healed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If vain, carnal, Thoughts, are not reſiſted at firſt, but given way to, they <hi>are hardly</hi> checkt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and turned upon other Objects, and therefore to watch the firſt Riſings of them.</p>
               <p>Now, not one of theſe Conſiderations, but may make a Child of God to tremble, how he lets forth his heart into vain, carnal, idle, defiling-thoughts, and muſings, which do ſo much waſte a gracious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and lay him open to ſuch woful dangers as theſe are.</p>
               <p>To help a Child of God in this Spiritual Work, of looking to, and a holy ordering the Thoughts of his Heart;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be deeply humbled to God,</hi> with abhorring and loathing, for Atheiſtical, unclean, proud, vain, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, worldly thoughts, that croud in upon you: when you make them your burden, you will be the ſooner eaſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Delight thy ſelf much in the Word of God, not onely in Publique Hearing, but Daily Reading; and not onely Reading, but <hi>getting ſome good word upon thy heart,</hi> that may <hi>ſeaſon</hi> thy Thoughts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: ſaith <hi>David, I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love,</hi> Pſal. 119.113. The love of the Word of God, made him be ſo far from cheriſhing vain Thoughts, that he did <hi>hate</hi> them. It doth appear, this was a ſpecial part of <hi>David's</hi> exerciſe of Spirit, to get ſome bleſſed Word upon his heart, and be thinking of it, and ſo it did tu n into the ſweet and wholeſome nouriſhment of the New-Creature: <hi>Oh
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170425:124"/>
how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day.</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and holy practiſe, worthy a gracious Saint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: you have one word ſpecially, that <hi>David</hi> had much on his heart, out of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (for we know not whether any other Scriptures were then extant) 'tis that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. where the Lord ſaith, he will proclaim his Name and Glory: <hi>The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſs and truth,</hi> which you have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.15. &amp; 145.8. Happily one of thoſe ſweet words, which he often magnifies: how hath a ſingle word dwelt upon the heart of a Child of God, and hath kept the heart ſavoury for Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Remedy againſt ſuch Thoughts, is, <hi>Much Prayer;</hi> diligence, fervency, powring out the heart to God, till the heart melts, and runs forth ſweetly, ſpiritually, and is engaged with God, and hath a ſight of him, and a divine impreſſion of God's Majeſty left upon the Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get more and more <hi>brokenneſs of heart for ſin;</hi> when the Heart hath been broken, 'twill not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get into Vanity again: At leaſt, a Child of God ſhould take care that it ſhould not, when the Heart is broken and mourning, the Spirit doth wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that work refine the Heart: All the ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, defilement, diſtraction, that comes upon the New-Creature, is moſtly for want of this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Mortification of that Corruption,</hi> that is moſt apt to ſtirre, doth much cure our thoughts: Inordinate Affections are the Saints greateſt Evils, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak an unmortified heart, as to what a Child of God ſhould ſtill be preſſing after; even to be dead and crucified with Chriſt. <hi>Thoſe that are Christs
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170425:124"/>
have crucified their Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Contending for a <hi>Spiritual Heart.</hi> So far as the Heart is ſpiritual, it acts ſpiritually: 'Tis the carnality of Heart, that works-up all thoſe frothy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that defile us. <hi>Paul's</hi> corruption was much let out upon him, when he cryes out of the carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. which ſhould be the daily complaint of God's poor children.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A great help to the preſerving the Thoughts of the Heart, according to the New-Creature, will be to conſider, <hi>How precious the thoughts of God are to his People,</hi> Pſal. 139.17. <hi>How precious alſo are thy thoughts, O God, unto me? How great is the ſum of them? If I ſhould count them, they are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then the ſand</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 2. was conſidering how God's Eye was upon his Thoughts, and 'twas a means to rectifie them: and then <hi>David</hi>'s thoughts run forth in the ſweet and bleſſed apprehenſion of the preciouſneſs of God's thoughts to him, from all Eternity, and in the ways of his Covenant towards him: If God's thoughts to us be holy and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ever towards us, the thoughts of his ſervants ſhould be ſo alſo, and as little common and unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as may be.</p>
               <p>More particularly, let us yet conſider, what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and excellent, and glorious things, ſuch as are New-Creatures in Chriſt have, to exerciſe their thoughts about.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gracious Soules have the Attributes of God to exerciſe the thoughts of their Hearts in; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170425:125"/>
of God, his Greatneſs, Holineſs, Glory, &amp;c. A bleſſed Exerciſe for Saints indeed! So we finde the Scripture-Saints ſweetly taken up with contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and admiration of the Excellencies of God himſelf, <hi>Thou art glorious in Holineſs,</hi> Exod. 15.11. ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi> But, <hi>Thou art Holy,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 22. <hi>Oh how great is thy Goodneſs! Pſal.</hi> 8.31. as might be abundantly ſhewed; and the exerciſe of the thoughts this way, hath a powerful influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart, as to its <hi>abaſement, purity, ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Saints have the <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of the grace of God, in Jeſus Chriſt, towards poor ſinners, <hi>to be taken up</hi> withall: Oh the free, rich, diſtinguiſhing grace of God to a poor Creature, that was poſting to Hell, that was a Rebellious Wretch, a vile Hypocrite, the worſt of ſinners, the moſt unlikely to be converted of any ſinner in the World. We have <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart ſwallowed up in this above any other; as <hi>David</hi> in many Pſalms, is in the admiration of grace; and <hi>Paul</hi> in moſt of his Epiſtles makes it his great ſcope, as the great Argument, to be not onely believing, but humble, and holy, and heavenly, all their days: ſpecially, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1ſt, 2d, and 3d Chapters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saints have the unſearchable Riches of Jeſus Chriſt, to take up their thoughts with, the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Dignities of his Perſon, the Beauty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is in him, the depths of his love, the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs price of his bloud, his bowels to ſinners, his care of his Churches: Oh theſe are things worthy the thoughts of Saints indeed!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170425:125"/>4. They have to take up their thoughts, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bleſſedneſs of the forgiveneſs of their ſinnes: What a bleſſed ſtate! a ſtate of forgiveneſs in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, is! <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> oh bleſſed for ever, <hi>are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, who forgiveth all thine iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 103. <hi>God hath not appointed me to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation through my Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. Oh bleſſed extaſie, for a poor called pardoned Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be in!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as are New Creatures in Chriſt, they have <hi>the Mystery of the New Covenant,</hi> the everlaſtingneſs of it, to bring their hearts to, and <hi>to work the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> thereof upon their hearts, to muſe on the returns of their Prayers, to behold the continual Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God towards them, and his ways of mercy and kindneſs to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They have the ſhortneſs of their time, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their lives, the certainty of Death to muſe on; <hi>Lord, make me to know the number of my dayes, that I may know how frail I am:</hi> Yea, they have a future and eternal ſtate of bleſſedneſs and glory, to have their thoughts ſwallowed up into; That they ſhall one day ſee Jeſus Chriſt, as he is, in all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and never look off him any more: they ſhall do nothing elſe but love him, enjoy perpetual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, be praiſing, admiring, adoring the bleſſed Majeſty of God for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:170425:126"/>Oh! If there are ſuch excellent and bleſſed things, for the thoughts of the holy-ones of God, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in, oh! what bare Dunghill hearts have ſuch, that pore upon nothing but earth and filth. Let it not be ſo, with ſuch that have taſted the good and ſweetneſſe of thoſe things, that have a reall ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall ſoul-filling goodneſſe in them; What matter of Complaint to Gods poor Children, whoſe hearts are too too apt to ſink earth-wards, poys'd with weights that they cannot keep them up in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, his Chriſt, and what ever is bleſſed in him; Oh! when the thoughts of your hearts muſt be taken up with your Callings, which cannot be done without it, keep a watch over them, let them not run forth to ſinfull diſtempers, but that you may be fit to go to God, and converſe with him, and get the bleſſed ſavour of theſe things upon your hearts, and do not let out your thoughts to idleneſſe, and ſoul-defiling vanity, and feed upon vanity, when there are ſuch ſolid glorious things to feed upon, which you expect to be taken up with in, an infinite unwearied delight, to all eternity.</p>
               <p>And do not ſuffer the Devil to take up his abode, by his ſubtle and ſuddain ſuggeſtions, or more cloſe inſinuations upon you. If he make his inroads, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, check, defie, with abhorrency, his firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, before he work up corruption in you; And remember ſtill, your ſpirits and bodies are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God, and <hi>the Temple of God muſt be Holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <hi>What? know ye not, that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt that is in you which ye have of God, and ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price, therefore Glorifie God, with your ſpirits
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170425:126"/>
and bodies, which are Gods;</hi> And thus much of this ſpeciall evidence of the New-Creature, in the newneſſe of his thoughts, and the acting of them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Eighth diſcovery of the New Creature, is this,</p>
               <p>The New-Creature hath a <hi>new lip,</hi> a <hi>new tongue,</hi> let looſe to ſpeak of God, and for God; And this alſo I ſhall a little inſiſt upon; Saith our bleſſed Lord; <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. Good, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ſavoury words; To this we find the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures often preſſing; Saith the wiſe man, Prov. 20.15. <hi>The lips of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are a precious Jewell; The mouth of a righteous man is a well of Life; The lips of the righteous feed many,</hi> Prov. 10.11, 12. So the Apoſtle; <hi>Let no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the uſe of Edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers;</hi> Epheſ. 4.29. <hi>Let your ſpeech be alwayes with grace, ſeaſoned with ſalt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. By which places 'tis evident that a ſpecial diſcovery of the New-Creature is herein manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The New-Creature hath a <hi>New-tongue,</hi> to ſpeak <hi>Savourly,</hi> and <hi>Experimentally</hi> of the things of Chriſt, and the work of the ſpirit, Becauſe that which the heart is exerciſed with, it will be bringing forth. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; An evil man out of the abundance of evil in his heart bringeth forth evil things, As a good man doth good things, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.25, 8. If the heart and affections be ſpiritually exerciſed, the Tongue will be ſpeaking forth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:170425:127"/>2. Becauſe thereby A New Created Soul, doth give glory to God; they ſpeak of the Teſtimonies, works, goodneſſe, grace, and the wonders of the Love of <hi>God</hi> to poor ſinfull Creatures; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>God</hi> is much glorified; <hi>Come and hear, all he that fear God, and I will tell what he hath done for my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 66.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gracious hearts, <hi>do</hi> hereby, <hi>ſtirr up the grace of Chriſt in them;</hi> tis like the blowing of a ſpark, and makes the heart to glow ere it is aware; gracious Conference is the very breath of the Spirit, which kindles all our graces afreſh; as it was with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luke 24.32. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within, while he talked with us by the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Good Souls do not onely profit themſelves, in receiving good, but they profit others; one of the beſt wayes that we do good, in profiting weak Saints or ſinners; how hath a word ſpoken from a ſavory perſon, humbly and wiſely, dropt in upon the ſoul of a ſinner, which hath bin its firſt awakning. And ſo upon a poor weak tempted Child of <hi>God;</hi> how ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hath <hi>God</hi> ordered a word for a poor ſoul from conference with another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If a New-Creature in Chriſt hath <hi>a new tongue,</hi> as well as a new heart, Then let it be for conviction of ſinners, whoſe tongues as well as hearts, are exerciſed in vanity, altogether in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, or vain, or carnall, or worldly diſcourſes; This ſhewes there is no good treaſure in the heart; The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> followes this conviction very cloſely, and makes it the Character of a carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Believer, of falſe and dead faith, Jam. 1.26.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170425:127"/>
                  <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain.</hi> Tis but a <hi>ſeeming</hi> to be religious, a <hi>vain</hi> Religion, where the tongue hath a carnall Liberty; And he calleth the Tongue, <hi>A world of iniquity, ſet on fire of Hell, James</hi> 3.6. <hi>an unruly evil, full of deadly poyſon;</hi> verſe 8. The evils of the tongue that be-ſpeake a ſinner unregenerate, are theſe; and they are frequent among this generation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Speaking evil of the ſpirit of God,</hi> and wayes of <hi>God,</hi> and people of <hi>God;</hi> Oh! ſuch ſay they have the Spirit, that they be Holy, and they are ſo ſtrict, that they will not do ſuch and ſuch things as others do; This is a degree of Blaſphemy, and borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the brink of the unpardonable ſin. Theſe are ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle, <hi>Revilers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6, 11. and they, as ſuch, <hi>ſhall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The giving out of the Spirit upon plain meaning-people in the meaſure it now is, is a new thing, but not therefore to be deſpiſed and reviled.</p>
               <p>Every Town ad Family almoſt doth abound with this wickedneſſe, and dreadfull provocation, and 'tis the ſaddeſt ſigne upon the generality of people whatſoever; onely, 'tis to be hoped, they do it through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and God, as he hath done, may humble, and convert many of them, to the praiſe of his grace; onely let ſinners that have bin frequently ſhew'd the deſperate wickedneſſe of ſuch ſpeeches, of ſcoffing at the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and holineſſe, and call it Hypocriſie, tremble leaſt God give them up, when they ſin againſt conviction, and the clear light of the word in this matter.</p>

Yea, you who are engaged in <hi>worldly diſcourſes</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, in your families, at your doores, in the Streets; in idle and vain jeſting; you are not of <hi>God,</hi> born again by his ſpirit, you take no delight in the word of <hi>God,</hi> the meditation of your heart is not in it, you ſpeak little of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſavour it not; Tremble you worldlings, who ſhew it this way, at that word, 1 John 4.5. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them;</hi> If ye are of the world, you are not, as yet, of Jeſus Chriſt, the power,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170425:129"/>
love of this preſent World ruleth in you, and that may damn you for ever.</p>
               <p>Know, ſinners, you that make little conſcience of vain, profane words, (though you pretend to make ſome conſcience of your word of promiſe to men, for your credits ſake, and ſo think you have grace; all which a <hi>Turk</hi> will do) that by your words you ſhall be judged; And of <hi>idle words you ſhall give an account at the day of judgment; and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned,</hi> Math. 12.36, 37. Such words as we have opened, to be damning ſins. And, therefore, do not put off this guilt far from you, in ſaying, 'tis your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and ſo make light of it: but know, 'tis guilt which will ſend you to Hell, if the Lord humble you not, and change you.</p>
               <p>'Tis a certain Rule; a profane heart, and a profane mouth; a carnal heart, a carnal tongue; a worldly heart, a worldly, (yea Sabbath-days) tongue: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you are not New Creatures, in the leaſt; and therefore begin with the heart, that the heart may be ſmitten of God for this ſin, and changed, and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the word and grace of Chriſt upon you; and it will be better with you, and you will have a tongue to ſpeak well of the Spirit, and the things of God, and his People; and to ſpeak for God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of his Name, and delight your ſelves in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let this be a word to ſuch as, through grace, are become New Creatures in Chriſt, that you would ſhew it in this Diſcovery, in a <hi>new tongue,</hi> that you give not your ſelves that liberty of vain, carnal, much leſs profane Diſcourſe, as formerly; as indeed you will not, if you be New Creatures. Men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170425:129"/>
doth either lye among ſuch as are wholly carnal and worldly, or ſuch as ſavour that which is good.</p>
               <p>As to the former; as in all our carriage, ſo ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our words, there is great caution to be had.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to mix our ſelves with them unneceſſarily, unleſs we find we have ſtrength enough, through a dependency on the Lord, to avoid their ſnares, and do it with a purpoſe of heart, to do them good, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, or counſelling them. Many a good ſoul hath been ſadly worſted, by mixing unneceſſarily, with vain, profane, or frothy company.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Providence caſt thee amongſt them, ſometimes it may be the wiſdome of a Child of God to <hi>keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, when the Wicked is before me:</hi> I ſay it may be ſometimes beſt for a Child of God to do ſo: there's a ſecret conviction goes forth, by the ſilence of a ſervant of God oftentimes, and to leave them as ſoon as we can; ſo it be not done ſcornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but humbly and civilly: I do not mean a total ſilence, but a warineſs.</p>
               <p>When you are caſt among carnal perſons, as to your Callings, neceſſarily: Take heed of giving your ſelves a full liberty, multiplying of words unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, but be reſerved, and watchful; That by any thing you ſay, or indeed any other carriage, the perſon you converſe with, be more hardned in his carnal courſe, or be offended more againſt the wayes of godlineſs; which, indeed, a Child of God ſhould
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170425:130"/>
moſt heedfully conſider in all his ways: Oh 'tis a bleſſed and gracious deſign, rather to better, then worſt, all we converſe with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you have a heart, (as you are to look up to God for a heart) to reprove what may be reprovable, (as often it may be your duty), or to commend the ways of God unto them, to render them acceptable and precious, and comfortable, or any good word of the Lord to mention to them, or of an eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; let this be done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Seaſonably:</hi> 'tis a great matter for a ſervant of God to ſpeak fitly, to wind off another from a carnal Diſcourſe into good things; to inſinuate them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly: here is much wiſdome, and 'tis to be askt of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With Meekneſs:</hi> Not ſharply, nor raſhly, nor proudly, nor cenſoriouſly, but with a <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſpirit, — <hi>ſhewing all meekneſs to all men,</hi> 2 Titus 2. That they may perceive you do it, not to cenſure them, nor with vain oſtentation, but that it proceeds from an honeſt heart, and unfeigned love to them: This is to be done, when we find mens ſpirits in the moſt ſerious capacity; and we having endeavoured to <hi>ſweeten</hi> them, and to get ſome room and reſpect in their Affections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it be done <hi>ſavourily,</hi> and <hi>feelingly,</hi> not ſleightly; that it may appear, what we give out to them, is upon our own hearts, and what we do really feel and enjoy, which carries much convincement with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Providence caſt you among God's people, (as this indeed ſhould be our choice,) 'tis not well
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170425:130"/>
to part from each other, without ſomething of God, his Word, Grace, Goodneſs, Providence, People, their own Hearts, Temptations, Comforts, according to what is upon their Hearts, or what they conceive may be of beſt uſe to thoſe we ſpeak to, conſidering their condition, or temptations, or fallings ſhort, or in what, if ſtronger Chriſtians, we may our ſelves be helped and encouraged; And not to give way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, or temptation, or fear we ſhall ſpeak as Hypocrites (which is ſometimes a ſnare) but to have a <hi>ready mind,</hi> &amp; chearful delight to do it: Not but the people of God may, in due ſeaſon, ſpeak of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and of Affairs and Occurrences in the World; yea, and ſometimes that which may beget chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo we watch our hearts in it, and take heed of an uncomely inordinateneſs in it.</p>
               <p>But do you tremble at obſcene words, wrathful words, to be ſuddainly provokt to ſpeak paſſionately, at taunting jeering words, reproaching others, or cenſorious of others, vain-glorious words: of which much might be ſpoken to every particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As this may humble the people or God, for the ſins of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> their vanity and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo let it ſtir them up, to look up for grace, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this ſo weighty a matter; That our <hi>Lips</hi> may be as a Well of Life, and may ſavour of what is holy and good in God's ſight: Some Directions yet, as to this Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Get in much good Treaſure in the Heart:</hi> As our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. The more good Treaſure
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170425:131"/>
of the Word, of Grace, of Experiences, of ſweetneſs, of comfort, the more ready we ſhall be to give forth, and alſo receive in from others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not follow <hi>your fancy,</hi> in ſpeaking what it ſtill dictates, but <hi>your judgment:</hi> Many good men too too much follow a working fancy, though there may be a ſober chearful Exerciſe of it in ſeaſon; but we are too apt to run forth to exceſs: The Devill will kindle Squibs upon the Fancy, which we muſt rather quench, then feed and bring forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep ſome good thing upon the Heart:</hi> Some good word you daily take in, as was directed as to your Thoughts, ſome comfortable Experience of God, the ſenſe of what you received in an Ordinance, that you may diſcourſe of the Word laſt heard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>My heart is enditing of a good matter, my Tongue is the Pen of a ready Writer:</hi> Oh bleſſed! when 'tis ſo with gracious Soules: <hi>I muſe on the works of thy hands,</hi> Pſal. 143.5. <hi>My meditation of God ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Pray a good frame of heart, and keep it ſo:</hi> Pray till the heart be made tender, ſavoury, quickned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, with the ſenſe of God's Majeſty, Holineſs, and Goodneſs upon your Spirits, and then watch to keep them ſo; a ſavoury Heart, and a ſavoury Mouth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be not provoked by the vain and frothy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of others, though they may be good men, to comply with it: We are too apt to take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that which may be evil, becauſe 'tis the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty another good man takes, which is often a ſnare.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:170425:131"/>6. Keep the fear of the Lord upon thy Heart, a holy awe of God and his Prefence, one of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Duties of a Saint, ſpecially in this matter. The fear of God makes the Spirit ſerious, and yet mixt with comfort and a comely chearfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Stand in awe of God, and ſin not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might alſo lay down Motives to this choiſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It doth much pleaſe and delight the Spirit of God; it brings in much good to the ſoul; Gracious conference is an Ordinance of God, and bleſt to the quickning, eſtabliſhing, ſuccouring, and refreſhing the hearts of Saints. Accuſtome your ſelves to it, and you will find indiſpoſitions wear off, and you will do it out of a ready mind, and gracious delight: Onely, be not onely a Talker, from Notions in the Head, nor affect a diſputing wrangling Knowledge, (uſually the effect of Pride) but do it from Heart-experience in ſome meaſure; or what you would fain get more upon your Hearts: And let it not be onely a talking-knowledge, but an humble walking-knowledge.</p>
               <p>Remember, to thy continual abaſement, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinners thou haſt helped Hell-ward, by thy leud, vain, profane ſpeeches, by thy reviling at the Lords ways and people, and how thou haſt encouraged and hardned them this way, in ſin. Oh now let thy work be, through infinite grace, to tell ſinners, that there is more good infinitely in Jeſus Chriſt, then in the way of folly. Now draw as many as thou mayeſt, according to thy meaſure of grace, to Jeſus Chriſt, and Heaven-ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:170425:132"/>And thus much be ſpoken of this Diſcovery of the New-Creature, in its ſhewing it ſelf in a new Lip.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The 9th Diſcovery of the New-Creature.</p>
               <p>Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, they will have <hi>New-Company.</hi> As ſoon as a ſoul is new forming up in Chriſt, he ſaith, as <hi>David, Depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep the Commandements of my God,</hi> Pſa. 119.115. <hi>Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping,</hi> Pſal. 6.8. <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119.63. So the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints, as ſoon as converted, they become <hi>Companions</hi> of the reproached Ones of the Lord, and <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods</hi> with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. And ſo <hi>Moſes, choſe affliction with the people of God,</hi> before Riches and Honour with the profane, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.</p>
               <p>Now this real Converts do:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe wicked and carnal men will act and ſpeak wickedly againſt God, and his ways and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which a heart broken, and made tender, cannot endure to hear and obſerve: <hi>David</hi> ſaid, it was like a <hi>ſword in his bones,</hi> Pſal. 42.10. when wicked men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Lord and his ſervants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Converts are <hi>in great danger to be tempted to ſin,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> houſe, by the company of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and carnal perſons; the Devil will lay ſnares, ſpecially for weak ſouls: it will be hard for weak ſouls to paſs without guilt, by mixing with them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:170425:132"/>3. Saints <hi>will contract deadneſs and indiſpoſition,</hi> by their company, it cauſeth old Luſts to ſtir, and other ſins of heart to be working. The carnal part will be too ready for complyance with them; how hard to come off from them, not worſted?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, have quite <hi>different ſpirits</hi> from wicked and carnal men, <hi>different principles, different ends,</hi> and therefore they muſt needs avoid them, and cannot take ſatisfaction and contentment with them, unleſs under great temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To ſinners unconverted, who take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in your carnal merry company, but are burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the company of godly, and you ſecretly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them, and the Devil ſuggeſts to you, that they are Hypocrites; know this, and be aſſured of it, and your Conſciences muſt acknowledge it, that ye are yet in your ſins, and haters of holineſs, and you love not the appearance of it; Certainly, you are none of theſe New-Creatures, and you cannot know your ſelves by a better Character, then by the company you moſt delight in. You do not make choice of your moſt intimate company by their godlineſs, but from worldly ends, or mirth or good-fellowſhip, as you ſtyle it, or generoſity, or ſome ſuch carnal end: verily, the grace of God is not in you, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is damnable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ever you would find mercy, look up to the Lord to turn your hearts to himſelf, and then to thoſe that fear him: Break off from your vain-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who engage your hearts to vanity: What ſaith the Wiſdome of God, <hi>A Companion of Fools ſhall be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170425:133"/>
deſtroyed,</hi> Prov. 13. No ſuch fooles (how witty, or prudent, or civill ſoever otherwiſe) as carnall ſouls, that delight in vanity; Oh! hearken to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the wiſe, and your ſoul ſhall live; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this is the hardeſt pluck in converſion, but yet it muſt be done, with a vigorous reſolution, through grace; when once the bands are broken, and you come to find, as you will, abundant more ſweetneſſe in the Lords wayes, verily you ſhall never repent your ſo doing.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as have ſome deſires towards goodneſſe, and have ſome better thoughts then you have had formerly of good people, you will make little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in grace and peace and comfort to your own ſouls, till you do this; till you can abhor your ſelves for your vanity and profaneſs among carnall men, and can with full purpoſe of heart cleave to the Lord, and overcome fear or ſhame, or what ever ſuch curſed evils that are in your way, and all your rocks of offence, you will make little of it as to evidence any ſound work in your hearts, and peace with God by Jeſus Chriſt; one day's accompanying with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men will ſet you more backward, in the matter of godlineſſe, than many dayes after will help on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let ſuch as would evidence the New-Creature, be very watchfull in this matter, and not to touch pitch leſt they be defiled; mixe not your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, as hath bin exhorted in the laſt head, among carnall men, unleſſe you have a good and holy end in it; ſo as Jeſus Chriſt did, going among great ſinners to do them good, which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakes a great ſtrength of grace, and a Chriſt-like
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170425:133"/>
ſpirit, and Saints ſhould be much with <hi>God</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>And among your ſelves; that Saints do ſtill better and not worſt one anothers Spirits, when they come together: the more you are with Saints, the more you love them, and delight in them; Have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate healing ſpirit to one anothers infirmities, and be not offended but look upon, and love the appearance of <hi>God</hi> in each other; And remember that receiving and doing of good, is your great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, till you come to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Yea, let all that have a new work upon them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently find out the Company of Saints, ſuch as are viſibly joyned to the Lord, and to each other, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ordinances holily, and to help one another hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward; <hi>Woe to him that is alone,</hi> ſaith the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>God;</hi> Let not gracious ſouls content themſelves in pollutions of worſhip, and without the company of the godly; ſuch do decay, wither, make a poor ſhift to hold out in their profeſſion, grow worldly, or are overtaken with the errours of the times; as for the moſt part they are the ſolitary profeſſours who are drawn aſide from Goſpel-truth, and not ſuch, (as it hath bin unduly charg'd) who are in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to help, ſtrengthen, pray for, watch over each other.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, they have, (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>new feet,</hi> namely, to <hi>walk with God</hi> in a <hi>new converſation; The ſteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way,</hi> Pſal. 37.23. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:170425:134"/>This <hi>New walk</hi> of a Saint, of a New-Creature, is a large field; that I may hint the moſt materiall things of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A New-Creature doth more and more ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>walk with God;</hi> (1.) As <hi>under the eye of God,</hi> conſidering that the jealous eye of the Lord is ſtill upon him; <hi>Thou compaſſeſt my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my wayes,</hi> Pſal. 133.3. (2.) To <hi>keep Communion with God;</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God, ſpeaking with God, and unto God, and waiting to hear God ſpeak unto him; (3.) <hi>To walk in Jeſus Chriſt. As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him,</hi> Col. 2.6. which is, to walk in the <hi>Life</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Strength</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of Chriſt; and ſo in all; This tis to have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk in him; to do all in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, is the main work of the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as 'twas hinted in diſcovering the neceſſity of the New-Creature's being in Chriſt. (4.) The Walk of the New-Creature is <hi>to walk in the Spirit;</hi> Gal. 5.25, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit. There's no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.11. To walk in the Spirit, is, (1.) Not <hi>to fulfill the Luſts of the fleſh,</hi> Gal, 5.16. Not to be under the power of them, or to make proviſion for them; not to feed them, but to <hi>crucifie</hi> them; <hi>They that are Christ's, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts;</hi> Gal. 5.24. which is put as an evidence of walking after the Spirit; (2.) Tis to be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.18. to give up our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170425:134"/>
ſelves to the <hi>leadings</hi> and <hi>teachings</hi> of the Spirit, Pſal. 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy ſpirit is good; lead me into the Land of uprightneſſe;</hi> is the cry of every true Convert in Chriſt; who would not be led by his own ſpirit in any thing, nor by other mens ſpirits, but waites for the Leading of the ſpirit in every work, and way, wherein he would walk before God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The New-Creature <hi>walks after the revealed will of God; And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them,</hi> Gal. 5.16. ſpeaking of the New-Creature who walkes after a <hi>rule; Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.1. He ſets himſelf to walk in <hi>all</hi> the precepts of God, and eſteemeth them all holy and righteous.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The New-Creature <hi>walks in his integrity; let integrity and uprightneſſe preſerve me,</hi> Pſal. 25.21. <hi>As for me, I will walk in mine integrity,</hi> Pſal. 26.11.— And as for me thou <hi>upholdeſt me in mine integrity, and ſettest me before thy face for ever,</hi> Pſal. 41.12. This is the gracious reſolution of every Convert to walk in his inregrity, through which God will preſerve and uphold him in all his wayes, and when the world reproacheth him, God will ſet him before his face, and that, for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The New-Creature, ſo far as he is a New-Creature, <hi>walkes humbly. This is that the Lord doth require of thee, to walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Micah. 6.8. To walk humbly before the Lord, towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and towards Saints; The ſoul that walkes moſt with God, walkes moſt humbly towards men.</p>

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:170425:135"/>7. The New-Creature <hi>walks in love: And walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. In <hi>love</hi> to all Saints, as Saints; a ſpecial part of the Goſpel-walk: Not in love to ſuch or ſuch a party of Saints, which is but ſelf-love, but in love to all that walk with God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. More Particulars might I mention, as <hi>walking honeſtly</hi> towards all men, not oppreſſing, defrauding, but <hi>righteouſly, charitably, compaſſionately:</hi> ſo far, I ſay, as he is a New-Creature, he walks thus: Onely let me adde this, That the New-Creature <hi>walks by Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>and not by ſight.</hi> He is ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a life of dependency, lives upon the All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the fulneſs of his Grace, the Word of his Promiſe; and ſo lives out of himſelf, upon the fulneſs of God in Chriſt, and his truth in his Promiſe, even when he feels not his preſence. And herein, briefly, conſiſts the Life of Faith, to live out of our ſelves, upon Another, even the Fullneſs of an infinite God, manifeſted in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In a word, The New-Creature in Chriſt, as he is called of God, through infinite Free-grace: ſo is he to <hi>walk</hi> in all things, <hi>Worthy of his Vocation,</hi> Epheſ. 4.1. To walk worthy of the Lord, even to <hi>walk</hi> as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. To walk in this preſent world, how he might expreſs the vertues of Chriſt, the grace and love of Jeſus Chriſt ſo freely revealed to him, to walk ſelf-denyingly, holily, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, harmleſly, profitably, heavenly, as one that is called from Darkneſs to Light, from the power of Satan to God, called out of the World, <hi>to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170425:135"/>
of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If his be the Walk of the New-Creature, then ſuch who walk not as in the Eye of God, but after the Atheiſme of their Hearts; conſider not, that God ſees them in their moſt hidden ways, that walk after their Luſts to fulfill them; that walk not in the Spirit; that mind not Holineſs, ſo they keep a kind of Conſcience to men: Verily, the Spirit of God dwelleth not in you, you have no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven as yet; you are of the World, and you walk after the courſe of <hi>the World,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. You walk Hell-ward, and are held by the Cords of your Luſts, and your Paths lead unto deſtruction. And therefore turn in to Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Paths are Wiſedome and Safety, and lead in the Way of Life, and Peace, and Bleſſedneſs, even all that chooſe them, and delight in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let ſuch as have the New-Creature formed in them, approve themſelves to God, to Saints, and to the World, in this their <hi>New-Walk:</hi> Oh ſee! you are called to walk with God; and therefore be, as in his Eyes, continually: make Communion with him, your chiefeſt joy. Walk <hi>in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, in his Life, Light, Power, Love, Wiſdome, and fetch your daily ſupplies from him: Walk in the Spirit, after the Spirit, as much as may be; and ſee that you keep cloſe to Rule, to the revealed Will of God, and not to Deluſions. Be able to appeal to God; Judge me, oh God, according to mine integrity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.1. that you may have this peace and comfort in all your ways; Thou upholdeſt me, oh Lord, in mine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170425:136"/>
integrity. And ſee you walk <hi>humbly</hi> before GOD and Men, and in love to all that profeſs love to Chriſt; and they do, in ſome meaſure, <hi>really</hi> expreſs it, and carry it juſtly, and compaſſionately towards all men.</p>
               <p>Learn above all, the Experience of the Life of Faith: live not in, or upon what you have received; but live out of it, upon the Fulneſs of the Lord, as if you had received nothing. Oh ply the Throne of Grace, that you may be filled with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk in this preſent World, as near, as may be, after the Holineſſe, Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Wiſdome, and Love of Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſhewed towards all men, having your Hearts and Converſations in Heaven, where your Treaſure is.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The New-Creature doth in all things labour its own perfection, and is therefore ſtill in confli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting with, deſtroying, crucifying, purging out the old Creature, the old man, all of the Old <hi>Adam;</hi> till it ſits down in Victory, in a full perfection of Holineſſe and Glory, which it ſhall have, (and not till then) at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. — <hi>That ye put off concerning the former Converſation, the Old Man, which is corrupt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful Lusts, and be renewed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Knowing this, that our Old Man is crucified with Him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed,</hi> Rom. 6.6.</p>
               <p>This is the main Work of the New-Creature, where it is really formed in Chriſt, to deſtroy and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170425:136"/>
purge out the Defilements and Dregs of the Old Man, of Sin, Self, Corruption, that it may be as <hi>a new Lump;</hi> as a Veſſel made meet for the Lord's uſe, as <hi>formed up, ſet apart, anointed, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed</hi> for God, and his Uſe, here, and for ever, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
               </p>
               <closer>To the Bleſsed God Alone, be all the Glory.</closer>
